This was clearly \\nnot in line with the goals we set for 2018, and not where we \\nneed to be.  The reduced sales resulted in an operating loss \\nof $(854,000), contrasted with operating income of $463,000, \\nwhich  we  achieved  in  2017.    It  is  clear  from  our  reported \\nperformance this year that we faced significant headwinds \\nin  our  traditional  distribution-based  and  service-operator-\\nbased markets. While we are concerned about prospective \\nrevenues for the first half of 2019, we are diligently working \\nthe  areas  that  need  to  be  addressed,  in  an  effort  to \\nreverse this trend during the second half of the year.  The \\nimprovement in our liquidity as a result of the sale/leaseback \\nof  our  Old  Bridge  facility,  provides  us  with  the  flexibility  to \\nremain on task in pursuit of several initiatives that we have \\nundertaken over the past six months, which we believe will \\nbear fruit as the year progresses.\\n\\n2018 and 2019 Improvement Targets\\n\\nIn my letters to you for the years 2016 and 2017, we outlined \\nthe areas within which we needed to achieve major improve-\\nments the following year in order to effect a successful turn-\\naround in our financial performance, and as a result of those \\nmajor improvements, drive an increase in stockholder value. \\nWe remain committed to achieving those goals. \\n\\nThe target areas where we will continue to \\nconcentrate our efforts are as follows: \\n•  Enhance capital resources and liquidity \\n•  Expand sales initiatives to the large, Tier 1 and Tier 2  \\n   service providers\\n•  Accelerate R&D activities to develop ideal solutions for  \\n   our customers and prospects\\n•  Implement an operational efficiency initiative to minimize  \\n   corporate overhead\\n•  Increase services and support components of revenues\\n•  Achieve positive earnings from operations in 2019\\n\\nThe Old Bridge facility sale/leaseback has provided us with \\nsubstantially  improved  capital  resources,  which  will  further \\nmany of the goals described above. Accelerated R&D and \\npenetration  into  Tier  1  service  providers  require  capital \\nspending for people and technology in advance of reaping \\nthe rewards that can be derived from them.  Our improved \\nbalance  sheet  should  give  us  the  runway  that  we  need  to \\nsuccessfully implement our strategy.\\n\\nIn 2018 we made progress on several fronts, but experienced \\nsetbacks  in  several  others.  We  are  continuing  to  work  the \\nengineering,  sales,  operational,  and  financial  improvement \\nprocesses  in  order  to  return  the  Company  to  a  sustained \\nperiod of increasing sales and profitability.\\n\\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\\n\\nThe  Old  Bridge  facility  sale/leaseback  has  resulted  in  the \\nCompany being debt free, retaining significant cash reserves, \\nwith an enhanced level of financial stability, and positioned to \\ninvest more aggressively in the development and promotion \\nof  new  products.    While  now  debt  free,  we  continue  to \\nconsider  our  relationship  with  our  lender,  Sterling  National \\nBank, to be important as we move forward.  We have made \\nsome  recent  modifications  to  our  credit  facility  and  expect \\nthat  further  changes  to  accommodate  our  progress  will  be \\nmade in the coming months.\\n\\nSales and Research & Development  \\n\\nWe believe that sustained growth will derive from committing \\nour resources to expanded sales initiatives, completion of key \\nproduct development and the creation of additional revenue \\nverticals.  Consistent  with  that  approach,  during  2018  we \\ntargeted the completion of new product designs to position \\nthe  Company  for  a  more  accelerated  growth  curve  in  the \\nfuture. We considered it to be especially important to position \\n\\n* This message contains “forward-looking” statements that are covered by the safe harbor more fully described in the paragraph entitled \\n“Forward-Looking Statements” set forth on page 2 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\\n\\n\\x0cat an increasing number of service provider customers.  In \\naddition,  the  company  continues  R&D  investment  in  areas \\noutside of the NXG product in line with anticipated near-term \\nmarket demands such as in ATSC 3.0 and improvements to \\nour popular ATSC 1.0 receivers, as well as MPEG Encode, \\nTranscode and IP streaming technologies supporting service \\noperator trends towards greater IPTV and video OTT services.\\n\\nIn  addition,  we  are  increasing  our  public  relations  outreach \\nincluding a focus on press releases associated with both new \\nand incremental product introductions. We will both expand \\nand repeat these activities throughout the year, including at \\nthe upcoming InfoComm and HITEC shows in June.\\n\\n“ BT\\'s flagship product, NXG, \\nis now being recognized by \\nTier 1 & Tier 2 customers for \\nwhat we believe it is: the most \\nadvanced, flexible, highest \\nvalue, IP/Digital video signal \\nprocessing solution available in \\nthe market today. ”\\n\\nOperating Expenses and Gross Margin\\n\\nOur diminished sales caused our operating income to swing \\nfrom  $463,000  in  2017,  to  a  loss  of  $(854,000)  in  2018. \\nAlthough  sales  decreased,  we  do  not  currently  see  market \\nforces eroding the gross margins of our core business and in \\nfact we achieved a slight increase in margin as a percentage \\nof  sales  in  2018,  with  a  blended  gross  margin  of  38.8%. \\nAdditionally, we are focusing on achieving further efficiencies \\nin areas of our business that do not contribute significantly to \\n\\nNeXgen Gateway (NXG)\\n\\n \\nthe new products and new system solutions to be those that \\nwill enable us to expand sales to the large Tier 1 and Tier 2 \\nservice providers.\\n\\nAs  reported  in  last  year\\'s  Letter  to  Stockholders,  a  portion \\nof these R&D efforts culminated in the introduction of BT’s \\nNeXgen  Gateway  (NXG)  product  line  in  October  2017. \\nAlthough our NXG product has been well received thus far, \\nNXG  sales  volume  for  both  2018,  and  the  first  quarter  of \\n2019 were below expectations as a result of Tier 1 and Tier \\n2 customer sales cycles taking longer than anticipated.  In an \\neffort to counteract extended sales cycles, we will continue \\nto  increase  NXG  related  2019  expenditures  in  two  areas: \\nfirst, we have accelerated R&D to complete features that will \\nenhance NXG’s utility and performance, and second, we have \\nincreased customer and prospect direct engagement as well \\nas  marketing  activity,  including  trade  show  and  technology \\neducation  initiatives,  to  increase  market  awareness  of  the \\nsignificant capabilities that the NXG product line has to offer.\\n\\nAs  a  result  of  R&D  efforts  in  2018,  we  have  also  greatly \\nincreased the number of customer applications NXG is able \\nto satisfy. As a result of our 2018 direct engagements, NXG \\nprevailed in yet another head-to-head Tier 1 service provider \\nevaluation during first quarter of 2019. We are also pleased \\nto report that those NXG systems that the Company has sold \\nto  date  have  all  been  operating  trouble-free.  We  are  very \\nenthusiastic and anticipate that NXG sales will steadily expand \\nduring 2019, and also expect that expansion to continue into \\nfuture periods as NXG is evaluated, approved, and deployed \\n\\n\\x0cour earnings and profits.  Those activities will be implemented \\nduring  the  second  quarter.  At  the  same  time,  we  firmly \\nbelieve  that  our  success  and  overall  achievement  of  our \\ngoals to meaningfully enhance stockholder value, will derive \\nfrom committing our resources to product development and \\npromotion,  and  the  creation  of  additional  revenue  verticals.  \\nWe  believe  the  imposition  of  overly  severe  spending  cuts \\nwould  undermine  our  product  development  and  market \\npenetration  efforts,  and  would  be  counter-productive  to  our \\ngoals.\\n\\nLooking to the Future\\n\\nThe  major  Company  operational  initiatives  for  2019  were \\ndesigned and planned during November/December of 2018 \\nand began execution in mid-December. These consist of an \\nexpansion in sales staff and refined sales focus, expansion \\nin  Blonder  Tongue  Laboratories’  brand  awareness  and \\nmarketing initiatives around the US, and planning efforts to \\nreach expanded sets of customer markets with current and \\nnew products.  We are planning to make significant progress \\non all of these initiatives during 2019.  \\n\\nBT’s NXG is now out of R&D, fully into production, actively \\nproviding service at an increasing number of live customer \\ndeployments, and NXG sales are increasing. The customer \\nexperience,  feedback,  and  system  performance  results \\nthus far have been extremely favorable. We will continue to \\naccelerate and expand NXG marketing and sales efforts for \\nthis extremely important product line. We invite you to read \\nthe accompanying SEC Form 10-K, where both greater detail \\n\\nand additional color are presented. We also invite you to join \\nus on our quarterly investor conference calls throughout the \\nupcoming year, where you will be able to directly interact with \\nthe senior management of the Company.\\n\\nIn October of 2018, we recruited Ted Grauch, a seasoned \\nindustry  executive,  with  direct  Tier  1  service  provider \\nexperience and expertise, to join and help lead the Company \\ninto the future. Although Ted has only been with Company for \\na short time, his guidance, observations, contributions, and \\naction plan for 2019 have been invaluable.\\n\\nBT’s  flagship  product,  NXG,  is  now  being  recognized  by \\nTier 1 & Tier 2 customers for what we believe it is: the most \\nadvanced,  flexible,  highest  value,  IP/Digital  video  signal \\nprocessing solution available in the market today. It is now \\ntime  to  capitalize  on  the  extensive  NXG  R&D  investment \\nmade  over  the  last  three  years.  We  recently  reorganized \\nand expanded the sales team to simultaneously accelerate \\nthe Tier 1 and Tier 2 service provider sales engagements, \\nincluding  opportunities  related  to  the  NXG  product  line,  \\nand  exploit  the  strength  and  reach  that  the  Company  has \\nenjoyed  for  many  years  in  its  valuable  distributor  and \\nintegrator relationships.\\n\\nThe  entire  Blonder  Tongue  team  wishes  everyone  a \\nsuccessful 2019.\\n\\nRobert J.

BUSINESS \\n\\nIntroduction  \\n\\n  Overview   \\n\\nBlonder Tongue, with its subsidiary R. L. Drake Holdings, LLC (“Drake”), is a technology-development and \\nmanufacturing company that delivers a wide range of products and services to the cable entertainment and media industry.  \\nFor  over  65  years,  Blonder  Tongue/Drake  products  have  been  deployed  in  a  long  list  of  locations,  including \\n(“MDU”),  broadcast  studios/networks,  universities/schools, \\nlodging/hospitality,  multi-dwelling  units/apartments \\nhealthcare/hospitals, fitness centers, government facilities/offices, prisons, airports, sports stadiums/arenas, entertainment \\nvenues/casinos,  retail  stores,  and  small-medium  businesses.    These  applications  are  also  variously  described  as \\ncommercial,  institutional,  and/or  enterprise  environments  and  will  be  referred  to  herein  collectively  as  “CIE”.    The \\ncustomers we serve include business entities installing private video and data networks in these environments, whether \\nthey  are  the  largest  cable  television  operators,  telco  or  satellite  providers,  integrators,  architects,  engineers  or  the  next \\ngeneration of Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) streaming video providers.  \\n\\nFrom the cable television pioneers that founded the Company in 1950, to the highly experienced research and \\ndevelopment  team  that  creates  new  products  today,  the  Company’s  success  stems  from  listening  to  the  needs  of  its \\ncustomers, providing quality products to meet those needs and supporting those products after delivery.  For over 65 years \\nBlonder  Tongue  has  been  providing  innovative  solutions  based  on  continually  advancing  technology,  enabling  the \\nCompany to maintain its position as a leader in many of the CIE markets it serves.  Since its founding, Blonder Tongue \\nhas continued to keep abreast of evolving technologies, from analog to digital television, Hybrid-Fiber Coax (“HFC”) \\nnetworks with Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) edge devices, High Definition (“HD”) and Ultra HD (4K) \\nencoding and transcoding, IPTV processing and distribution, and Multiscreen Adaptive Bit Rate based services.  \\n\\nThe  cable  television  market  has  reacted  quickly  to  consumer  demands  for  additional  services  by  integrating \\nmultiple technologies into existing networks, providing consumers with high speed internet access in addition to enhanced \\nvideo offerings.  Today, video offerings have expanded from traditional broadcast linear delivery to the living room TV to \\nlive streaming to any device in your home or on the go. Traditional TV content is now available in any format to be \\nviewed on tablets, mobile phones, computers or gaming consoles. Service Operators are migrating their video-on-demand \\n(“VOD”) architecture to an internet protocol (“IP”) multiscreen ecosystem, which is the first step in transitioning to an all \\nIP-based video delivery system.  CIE businesses are upgrading their networks from standard definition (“SD”) to deliver \\nHD content to their first screen (TV) and adding the capability of IP streaming, thereby expanding viewer access to HD \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\x0c• \\n• \\n• \\n \\n• \\n\\n \\n\\nstrengthen core business, \\ncontinue the heritage of technological development, \\nexpand into new markets, including penetration into MSO and broadcast television markets, as \\nwell as the emerging media company market and \\nincrease gross margins. \\n\\n \\n\\ncontent on any IP-connected devices.  The infrastructure requirements to enable IP streaming, provide the Company with \\nan opportunity to market and sell its expanded IP streaming encoders and digital product lines.  \\n\\nWhile  residential  growth  remains  relatively  flat,  the  CIE  environment  is  growing  ($10.95  billion  in  2018,  up \\nfrom $10.44 billion in 2017).  The CIE market segments that the Company serves have been focused on the migration to \\nIPTV networks.  The Company has expanded its video product line portfolio to address the growth of IP streaming.  The \\nCompany’s  recently  introduced  Scalable  Transcode-Encoder  Platform  (“STEP”)  transcodes  HD/SD  video  content  to \\nAdaptive Bit Rate video profiles supporting multi-screen protocols for further processing into the operator’s multiscreen \\nwork  flow.    The  Company  has  collaborated  with  cable  television  (“CATV”)  Multiple  System  Operators  (“MSOs”)  to \\nproduce a cost-effective encoder for IP support of Public Education Government (“PEG”) video content.  A custom hotel \\nguide solution was developed for MSOs, enabling them to extract guide source data from the headend and transmit it over \\ntraditional HFC networks to produce a custom hotel guide at a lower price than the traditional third-party guide solutions.  \\nThe Company introduced in 2017 the NeXgen Gateway (“NXG”) product line to specifically address the service provider \\nchallenges of migrating from traditional CATV HFC based topologies and technologies, to Internet Protocol (“IP”) based \\ntopologies  and  technologies.  As  the  industry  adopts  Ultra-HD  (4K)  and  High  Efficiency  Video  Coding  (“HEVC”) \\nencoding, the Company plans to produce products to support its traditional customers as well as new customers.  While \\nalready  experiencing  full  scale  commercialization  in  international  markets,  the  United  States  market  continues  to \\nincreasingly  embrace  IPTV  technology.    The  worldwide  market  now  has  over  208  million  IPTV  subscribers  and  is \\nprojected to have 229 million by 2020.  \\n\\nThe Company continues to advance the implementation of its strategic plan to maximize shareholder value.  The \\n\\n \\nCompany’s strategic plan consists of the following: \\n \\n\\nThe Company has entered into and renewed several agreements through which it has acquired rights to use and \\n\\nincorporate certain proprietary technologies in its digital encoder line of products, including:  \\n\\n1. \\n\\n2. \\n\\n3. \\n\\nImplementation  and  System  License  Agreement  with  Dolby  Laboratories  Licensing  Corporation \\n(“Dolby Labs”) for Dolby Digital Plus Professional Encoder, 5.1 and 2 channel licensed technology. \\n\\nLicense Agreement with LG Electronics as a Pro:Idiom content Protection System Manufacturer. \\n\\nOwnership  from  the  Motion  Picture  Experts  Group  of  an  MPEG-2  4:2:2  Profile  High  Level  Video \\nEncoder IP core. \\n\\nThe Dolby® Labs License Agreement grants the Company the right to manufacture, label and sell professional \\ndigital encoder products and consumer digital decoder products and to use the Dolby trademarks.  This technology has a \\nnumber of improvements aimed at increasing quality at a given bit rate compared with legacy Dolby Digital (AC-3).  Most \\nnotably, it offers increased bit rates, support for more audio channels, improved coding techniques to reduce compression \\nartifacts, and backward compatibility with existing AC-3 hardware.  \\n\\nThe LG Electronics license agreement provides the Company with certain technology necessary for production \\nof  EdgeQAM  devices  for  the  hospitality  industry.    Consequently,  content  can  be  transferred  through  and  among  these \\ndevices only if incorporating this technology.   \\n\\nThe Pro:Idiom digital technology platform provides the hospitality market with a robust, secure Digital Rights \\nManagement  (“DRM”)  system,  ensuring  rapid,  broad  deployment  of  HD  television  (“HDTV”)  and  other  high-value \\ndigital  content  to  licensed  users  in  the  lodging  industry.    Lodging  industry  leaders  such  as  World  Cinema  Inc.  have \\nlicensed  the  Pro:Idiom  DRM  system.    A  growing  number  of  content  providers  have  demonstrated  their  acceptance  of \\nPro:Idiom by licensing their HD content for delivery to Pro:Idiom users.   \\n\\nThe  MPEG-2  Encoder  IP  core  has  a  unique  compression  engine  capable  of  creating  HD  MPEG-2  real-time \\nencoding  of  a  single  channel  of  1080i/720p/480i  video.    The  use  of  this  real-time  encoding  technique  enables  the \\nCompany to provide broadcast MPEG-2 HD and SD encoding.  MPEG-2 is widely used as the format of digital television \\n\\n3 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nsignals that are broadcast by terrestrial (over-the-air), cable, and direct broadcast satellite TV systems.  The Company’s \\nrevenues for digital encoders were $6,873,000 in 2018 and $6,957,000 in 2017.  \\n\\nThe  H.264/AVC  is  a  video  compression  standard  that  enables  a  compelling  solution  for  growing  IP  video \\nservices.  The H.264 HD Encoder core has the capability to cut the bandwidth requirement for digital video delivery in \\nhalf  when  compared  against  MPEG-2  encoders.    This  essentially  facilitates  the  transmission  of  twice  the  number  of \\nprograms in a given bandwidth.  The use of this H.264 encoding technique enables the Company to provide high quality \\nvideo  at  higher  resolutions  like  720p  &  1080i.    H.264  is  a  widely  used  format  for  transmitting  high  quality  digital \\ntelevision signals over IP networks.  The Company started shipping the H.264 encoders in 2012. \\n\\nThe Company’s manufacturing is allocated primarily between its facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey (the “Old \\nBridge Facility”) and a key contract manufacturer located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).  The Company \\ncurrently  manufactures  most  of  its  digital  products,  including  the  latest  encoder  and  EdgeQAM  collections  at  its  Old \\nBridge  Facility.    Since  2007  the  Company  has  transitioned  and  continues  to  manufacture  certain  high-  volume,  labor \\nintensive products, including many of the Company’s analog products, in the PRC, pursuant to a manufacturing agreement \\nthat governs the production of products that may from time to time be the subject of purchase orders submitted by (and in \\nthe  discretion  of)  the  Company.    Although  the  Company  does  not  currently  anticipate  the  transfer  of  any  additional \\nproducts to the PRC for manufacture, the Company may do so if business and market conditions make it advantageous to \\ndo so.  Manufacturing products both at the Company’s Old Bridge Facility and in the PRC enables the Company to realize \\ncost reductions while maintaining a competitive position and time-to-market advantage.  \\n\\nThe Company may, from time to time, provide manufacturing, research and development and product support \\nservices  for  other  companies’  products.    In  2015,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  VBrick  Systems,  Inc. \\n(“VBrick”) to provide procurement, manufacturing, warehousing and fulfillment support to VBrick for a line of high end \\nencoder products and sub-assemblies.  Sales to VBrick of encoder products were approximately $793,000 and $840,000 in \\n2018 and 2017, respectively.  Sales to VBrick for sub-assemblies were not material in 2018 or 2017. \\n\\nThe Company was incorporated in November, 1988, under the laws of Delaware as GPS Acquisition Corp. for \\nthe purpose of acquiring the business of Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, which was founded \\nin  1950  by  Ben  H.  Tongue  and  Isaac  S.  Blonder  to  design,  manufacture  and  supply  a  line  of  electronics  and  systems \\nequipment principally for the private cable industry.  Following the acquisition, the Company changed its name to Blonder \\nTongue  Laboratories,  Inc.    The  Company  completed  the  initial  public  offering  of  its  shares  of  Common  Stock  in \\nDecember, 1995.  The address of the Company’s principal executive offices is One Jake Brown Road, Old Bridge, New \\nJersey 08857, and its telephone number at that location is (732) 679-4000. \\n\\nStrategy  \\n\\nIt is a constant challenge for the Company to stay at the forefront of the technological requirements of the CIE \\nmarket segments that it serves.  Changes and developments in the manner in which information (whether video, telephony \\nor data) is transmitted, as well as the use of alternative compression and delivery technologies, all require the Company to \\ncontinue  to  develop  innovative  new  products.    The  Company  allocates  its  resources  as  needed  to  create  innovative \\nproducts that are responsive to the demand for digital signal generation and transmission.  The Company’s key product \\nlines are more thoroughly discussed under “Key Products” beginning on page 7.  The ongoing evolution of the Company’s \\nproduct lines focuses on the increased needs created in the digital space by digital video, IPTV and HDTV signals and the \\ntransport of these signals over state-of-the-art broadband networks.   \\n\\nmulti-dwelling \\n\\nunits/apartments, \\n\\nThe  primary  end  locations  of  the  Company’s  product  are  the  CIE  environments  described  above,  including \\nuniversities/schools, \\nlodging/hospitality, \\nhealthcare/hospitals, fitness centers, government facilities/offices, prisons, airports, sports stadiums/arenas, entertainment \\nvenues/casinos,  retail  stores,  and  small-medium  businesses.    We  provide  a  wide  range  of  products  to  meet  the  special \\nneeds of these applications, and we serve many types of customers, from the large cable companies to private contractors.  \\nWe sell to anyone putting product into the CIE business market, including: \\n\\nstudios/networks, \\n\\nbroadcast \\n\\n•  Television broadcasters; \\n\\n•  Cable system operators (both large and small) that design, package, install and in most instances operate, upgrade \\n\\nand maintain the systems they build; \\n\\n•  Lodging/Hospitality video and high speed internet system operators that specialize in the Lodging/Hospitality \\n\\nMarkets; and  \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n•  Commercial/Institutional/Enterprise system operators that operate, upgrade, and maintain the systems that are in \\n\\ntheir facilities, or contractors that install, upgrade and maintain these systems in a wide variety of applications. \\n\\nThe key to proactively responding to the needs of the foregoing CIE environments is to build a suite of product \\nsolutions that are optimized for the operator’s existing infrastructure, as well as future strategy.  Operators look for the \\nfollowing features when selecting technology: \\n\\n•  Versatility  for  Now,  providing  multiple  source  inputs  and  different  output  formats,  including  simultaneous \\nQAM and IP capability.  Off-air local programs, locally generated content, and national broadcasts can all be \\nviewed on televisions via coax, as well as on desktops and other connected devices via an IP network.  This \\nallows operators to expand the reach of their video without having to run additional cable throughout the building \\nand optimize the use of coax and/or IP infrastructures. \\n\\n•  Flexibility for the Future, recognizing that even if an operator is not utilizing both QAM and IP outputs today, \\nthese features may be needed tomorrow.  Operators seek to choose scalable technology that can keep up with \\nadvances in system architecture and allow them to best leverage existing data and Wi-Fi infrastructure, without \\noverburdening it.  This includes considerations for TV Everywhere (bring your own content/device) as well as \\nrecently introduced Ultra-HD, also known as 4K. \\n\\n•  Affordability, by identifying high-quality, cost-effective, innovative solutions with a strong performance-to-cost \\nratio, is the key to insuring the operator can offer a competitively priced package to their business and enterprise \\ncustomers.    Focus  on  the  features  required  for  the  location  and  its  management,  including  remote  setup, \\nmonitoring and diagnostics through an IP interface and hot spare capability.  \\n\\nThe functions and features of the NXG product line are specifically targeted to deliver comprehensive and cost-\\n\\neffective solutions to all the market needs described in the forgoing paragraphs  \\n\\nA key component of the Company’s growth strategy is to leverage its reputation across a comprehensive product \\nline, offering one-stop-shop convenience to the cable, broadcast and professional markets and delivering products having a \\nhigh performance-to-cost ratio.  The Company has historically enjoyed, and continues to enjoy, a leading position in many \\nof the CIE and residential market segments that it serves.   \\n\\nMarkets Overview  \\n\\nThe television industry has been dominated by traditional cable operators, who subsequently expanded into high-\\nspeed  internet  and  telephony  services.    The  penetration  of  wireless  and  direct-broadcast  satellite  (“DBS”)  (such  as \\nDIRECTV® and DISH Network®) in the video market, while reduced, still has a combined subscriber count of almost 30.7 \\nmillion. Telephone companies (i.e. Verizon and AT&T) also compete with cable operators for services on a national level, \\ndelivering video, high-speed internet and telephony services direct to the home or to the curb with an estimate of over 8.3 \\nmillion subscribers.  \\n\\nWith  IPTV  technology  comes  additional  market  pressures  and  opportunities.    First,  there  is  the  matter  of \\nalternative TV services riding “Over the Top” of existing infrastructures (“OTT television”), where the delivered video is \\nnot part of the service provider’s own video service.  Examples include Web-delivered video such as Netflix, Hulu and \\nApple TV.  Cable, satellite and telco service providers will need to innovate to provide additional service offerings to \\ncompete with lower cost OTT television providers (subscribers exceeding 266 million).  In addition, content providers \\nsuch  as  HBO,  SHOWTIME  and  CBS  have  deployed  their  own  streaming  services,  without  requiring  a  cable  TV \\nsubscription.    Streaming  service  subscribers  are  now  larger  than  cable  TV  subscribers.    With  the  advent  of  “TV \\nEverywhere”, where video is displayed not only on the traditional television, but also on personal computers and mobile \\ndevices, cable operators are trying to tackle not only technological challenges associated with  these offerings, but also \\ncontent management and customer authentication.  The idea that the consumer is at the center, and not the hardware or the \\nnetwork, is revolutionizing how video (and media) content is delivered.   \\n\\nThe long term implications of these developments are increased competition for the provision of services and a \\ntrend  toward  delivery  of  these  services  using  IP  technology.    This  continuing  major  market  transition  has  resulted  in \\nincreased consumer expectations, placing the lodging and institutional markets under pressure to install new infrastructure \\nand upgrade existing networks.  It is not known how long this transition will take, but to remain competitive the Company \\nmust  continue  to  increase  its  product  offerings  for  digital  television,  encoding  and  decoding,  and  digital  media \\napplications. \\n\\n5 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cCable Television \\n\\n \\n\\nMost cable operators, large and small, have built networks with various combinations of fiber optic and coax \\ncable to deliver television, internet and telephone services on one drop cable.  Cable television deployment of fiber optic \\ntrunk has been completed in nearly all existing systems.  The HFC network architecture is employed to provide digital \\nvideo,  VOD,  HDTV,  IPTV,  high  speed  internet,  and  digital  telephone  service.    With  the  adoption  of  new  technology \\ndeveloped  by  CableLabs®,  the  cable  industry  is  using  “edge”  devices,  node  splitting  and  digital  video  switching  to \\nincrease both services and subscriber capacity from each node, to accommodate IPTV offerings in both residential and \\nCIE market deployments.  All of these networks are potential users of our product offerings. \\n\\nLodging \\n\\nHistorically, in response to lodging property owners seeking additional revenue streams and guests demanding \\nincreased  in-room  technology  services,  cable  operators  serving  the  lodging  market  sought  to  provide  more  channels \\n(especially in HD), VOD, and enhanced interactivity.  Initially installed mostly in large hotels, smaller hotels and motels \\ncontinue to be upgraded and outfitted with enhanced technology to provide a full suite of HD channels and VOD. \\n\\nMore recently, the competition among cable providers to the hospitality industry has shifted from emphasis on \\nVOD, to providing an ever-increasing number of HD programs free to each guest room and the capability of offering OTT \\ntelevision.  The Company believes that the demand for HD based headends that support free-to-guest service and OTT \\ntelevision, will continue to grow for several years.  The rate of growth is limited by the costs associated with replacing all \\ntelevisions  in  a  hotel  with  flat  screen  Pro:Idiom  compatible  televisions,  the  infrastructure  required  to  support  OTT \\ntelevision, authentication and system management issues. For several years, the Company has been providing a unique \\nsystem solution to the largest hotelier worldwide through the Company’s network of hotelier approved system integrator \\nand operator customers. The system consists of DOCSIS 3.0/3.1 compliant cable modem termination systems (“CMTS”) \\nand cable modems (“CM”) and is unique in that it is the only system approved by that hotelier that is able to provide a \\ncombination of the following services: linear TV, OTT, DOCSIS-based ethernet, and WiFi from a common mini-CATV-\\ntype HFC-based infrastructure. \\n\\nCIE-Commercial, Institutional, and/or Enterprise \\n\\nThe Company defines its target CIE markets to include educational campus environments, correctional facilities, \\nshort and long term health service environments, sports stadiums and airport terminals.  All of these seemingly unrelated \\nfacilities contain private networks that are dependent on either locally generated or externally sourced video and/or data \\ncontent.  As the advanced technologies of distance learning, HDTV and IPTV permeate the market, institutional facilities \\nare embracing these technologies to achieve site specific goals.  The following are examples of the types of applications:  \\n\\nPEG Town Hall Meetings and Local Sports \\n\\nPatient Education and Entertainment \\n\\n• \\n•  Reception Room TV- Doctors, Dentists and Corporate Offices \\n• \\n•  Distance Learning \\n• \\n•  Hotel Lobby Events and Advertising \\n\\nEmployee Facing- Training and Company Messaging \\n\\nThe Company traditionally benefited from a very strong share of this market with its Analog Video Headend and \\nDistribution Products.  We anticipate that we will continue to be a leader in this market with our digital video solutions \\nand our evolving IPTV platforms.   \\n\\nInternational \\n\\nThe Company has authorized distributors and sales agents in various locations outside the United States, but the \\nCompany primarily manufactures products for sale in the USA and North America.  Historically, international sales have \\nnot materially contributed to the Company’s revenue base.   \\n\\n6 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cAdditional Considerations \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  evolution  of  technology  with  respect  to  video,  internet  and  telephone  services  continues  at  a  rapid  pace.  \\nCable TV’s QAM video is competing with DIRECTV® and EchoStar’s DBS service and cable modems compete with \\ndigital subscriber lines and fiber-to-the-home offered by regional telephone companies.  Telephone companies are building \\nnational fiber optic networks and are delivering video, internet and telephone services directly to the home over fiber optic \\ncable,  and  digital  telephone  is  being  offered  by  cable  companies  and  others  in  competition  with  traditional  phone \\ncompanies.    The  convergence  of  data  and  video  communications  continues,  wherein  computer  and  television  systems \\nmerge.  This merging of technologies is extending services and content delivery to mobile smart phone devices and tablet \\ncomputers with over-the-air data delivery competing with cable- delivered services. \\n\\nLarger  MSOs  have  transitioned  or  are  in  the  process  of  transitioning  to  all-digital  platforms  (and  in  some \\ninstances MPEG-4/H.264).  Satellite DBS television, digitally compressed programming and IP delivery require headend \\nproducts, set-top decoding receivers, or digital terminal adapters, to convert the transmitted signals back to analog so that \\nthey may be viewed on analog television sets.  The split of analog and digital offerings provided to customers varies as a \\nfunction of the size of the operator and their deployment strategy.  For example, the majority of private cable and other \\nsmaller service providers continue to deliver an analog television signal on standard channels to subscribers’ television \\nsets  using  headend  products  at  some  distribution  point  in  their  networks  or  employ  set-top  boxes  or  digital  terminal \\nadapters at each television set.    \\n\\nKey Products \\n\\nBlonder Tongue’s products can be separated according to function and technology.  Four key categories account \\n\\nfor the majority of the Company’s revenue–Digital Video Headend, Analog Video Headend, HFC Distribution and Data: \\n\\n• \\nDigital  Video  Headend  Products  are  used  by  a  system  operator  for  acquisition,  processing, \\ncompression,  encoding  and  management  of  digital  video.    The  headend  is  the  center  of  a  digital  television \\nsystem.    It  is  the  central  location  where  multiple  programs  are  received  and,  through  additional  processing, \\nallocated to specific channels for digital distribution.  Blonder Tongue continues to expand its Digital Product \\nofferings to meet the evolving needs of its customers, which is expected to continue for years to come.  We offer \\na broad line of HD and SD, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4/H.264 encoders optimized for the CIE environment.  One \\nexample is a line of enhanced encoders optimized for the extreme demands of broadcasting live sports, another is \\na cost effective MPEG-2/H.264 encoder for IP support of PEG channels.  The Company’s STEP and custom \\nhotel  guide  products  were  developed  to  provide  solutions  for  certain  additional  needs  of  the  Company’s \\ncustomers and customer prospects, that the Company believes were not being met in a cost effective manner by \\nthe Company’s competitors.  IP interfaces have been added to a wide range of products to help in the migration \\nto  IPTV.    One  such  example  is  the  AQT8,  a  multichannel  8VSB/QAM-IP  transcoder  that  receives  off-air \\nbroadcast signals and transcodes them for coax and IP distribution.  Other lines of digital products provided by \\nBlonder Tongue and Drake include EdgeQAM devices and Satellite Quadrature Phase Shift Key (“QPSK”) to \\nQAM transcoders.   \\n\\nThe NXG is a powerful, two-way, forward looking platform that is ideal for delivering next generation \\nentertainment  services  to  both  enterprise  and  residential  locations,  including  hospitality,  educational,  MDU, \\nhealthcare, business parks, institutional, and sports venues, aptly described as “pocket community” settings. The \\ngoals  of  NXG  are  to  addresses  the  service  provider  challenges  of  (a)  migrating  from  traditional  CATV \\ntransmission such as fiber and coaxial cable, to fully IP based transmission, and (b) migrating from traditional \\ncontent protection, such as Arris DigiCipher®, Cisco PowerKEY®, and Pro:Idiom®, the IP based digital rights \\nmanagement  (“IP-DRM”)-  content  protection  systems  of  the  future,  such  as  Adobe  DRM®,  Verimatrix®, \\nWidevine®, and IP Pro:Idiom®. In order to accomplish those goals, NXG was designed to be an anything-in to \\nanything-out product.. As a consequence of the foregoing, NXG is a 100% fully modular, passive-back-plane-\\nbased product that enables the service providers to (a) easily and seamlessly accomplish the migration described \\nin the forgoing, and (b) to most cost effectively and seamlessly address what may become any future, unforeseen, \\nprospective transmission and content protection migrations. Unlike many other competing products, all “active” \\nelectronic components in the NXG product reside in their respective modules. There are no active components in \\neither the rack-chassis or backplane. The Company’s plan is for the functionality of all of the standalone key \\nsignal processing products described in the following paragraphs to be, over time, migrated and subsumed into \\nthe NXG product line. \\n\\n7 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nEncoders accept various input sources (analog and/or digital) and output digitally encoded HD or SD \\nvideo in various output formats such as Asynchronous Serial Interface (“ASI”), IP and QAM.  ASI is a streaming \\ndata format which carries the MPEG-2 Transport Stream.  The IP output format allows operators to stream video \\nover private data networks with greater reliability and content security.  The QAM outputs can be used for digital \\nvideo  distribution  over  typical  private  coax  networks  in  a  variety  of  CIE  environments  (i.e.  sports  arenas, \\nbroadcast and cable television studios, airports, hospitals, university campuses, etc.).  As a complement to the \\nencoder  line,  Blonder  Tongue  also  provides  digital  QAM  multiplexers  which  take  multiple  inputs  (ASI  or \\n8VSB/QAM)  and  deliver  a  single  multiplexed  QAM  output,  thereby  optimizing  the  HD  channel  lineup  by \\npreserving bandwidth.  The Company’s QAM output MPEG-2 encoders have a low latency feature and superior \\nmotion optimization for fast-paced sporting events, which is ideal for live sporting events within a stadium or \\narena.  \\n\\nATSC/QAM-IP Transcoder series of products (“AQT8”) allow the user to create a customized line up \\nfrom off-air and/or cable feeds for coax IP distribution.  The customizable IP output contains multiple programs \\nwith  a  combination  of  single  and  multiple  transport  streams,  from  multiple  RF  input  sources.    The  unique \\nMPEG-2 tables associated with each of the selected input programs are transferred to the IP outputs.  This means \\nthe virtual channel numbers and program names on the IP outputs can be the same as their RF program input \\nsources.  The Company’s AQT8 products enable the user to modify the metadata, including PSIP parameters, \\nsuch as the Program ID, Program #, Short Name, Major Ch., and Minor Ch. Information, to provide a customized \\nIP  program  delivery  solution.    The  AQT8-IP  features  Emergency  Alert  System  (“EAS”)  program  switching \\nthrough either an ASI or IP format EAS input and terminal block contacts for triggering. \\n\\nEdgeQAM devices accept Ethernet input and capture MPEG over IP transport streams, decrypt service \\nprovider conditional access or content protection, and insert proprietary conditional access, such as Pro:Idiom, \\ninto  the  stream.    These  streams  are  then  combined  and  modulated  on  to  QAM  RF  carriers,  in  most  cases \\nproviding  multiple  streams  on  to  one  6MHz  digital  channel.    Inputs  to  EdgeQAM  devices  can  come  from \\nsatellite receivers, set-top boxes, network devices or video servers.  The use of these devices adds flexibility for \\nthe  service  provider,  in  part,  because  all  of  this  routing  happens  in  one  device.    Scaling  is  accomplished  via \\nsoftware and modules embedded inside the hardware.  Since it is a true network device, the EdgeQAM can be \\nmanaged over a traditional Ethernet network or over the Internet.  \\n\\nThe  QPSK  to  QAM  transcoders  (QTM  Series)  are  used  for  economically  deploying  or  adding  a \\nsatellite-based tier of digital or HDTV digital programming.  The unit transcodes a satellite signal’s modulation \\nfrom QPSK to QAM or from 8PSK (HDTV Format) to QAM.  Since QPSK and 8PSK are optimum for satellite \\ntransmission  and  QAM  is  optimum  for  fiber/coax  distribution,  precious  system  bandwidth  is  saved  while  the \\nsignal retains its digital information.  Building upon the innovative design work that brought about the QTM \\ntranscoders,  QAM  up-converters  and  HDTV  processors,  the  Company  launched  a  series  of  ATSC/QAM \\ndemodulators.   \\n\\nDigital  Video  Headend  Product  use  continues  to  expand  in  all  of  the  Company’s  primary  markets, \\nbringing more advanced technology to consumers and operators.  It is expected that this area will continue to be \\na major component of the Company’s business.  The Company’s Digital Video Headend Products accounted for \\napproximately 48% and 41% of the Company’s revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  \\n\\n• \\nAnalog Video Headend Products are used by a system operator for signal acquisition, processing and \\nmanipulation to create an analog channel lineup for further transmission.  Among the products offered by the \\nCompany in this category are pre-fabricated headends to accommodate legacy analog TV systems, modulators, \\ndemodulators, and processors.  The Company’s Analog Video Headend Products accounted for approximately \\n8% of the Company’s revenues in both 2018 and 2017.  \\n \\n• \\nHFC Distribution Products are used to transport signals from the headend to their ultimate destination \\nin  a  home,  apartment  unit,  hotel  room,  office  or  other  terminal  location  along  a  fiber  optic,  coax  or  HFC \\ndistribution network.  Among the products offered by the Company in this category are broadband amplifiers, \\ndirectional taps, splitters and wall outlets for coax distribution and fiber optic transmitters, receivers (nodes), and \\ncouplers.  In cable television systems, the HFC distribution products are either mounted on exterior utility poles \\nor  encased  in  pedestals,  vaults  or  other  security  devices.    In  CIE  systems  the  distribution  system  is  typically \\nenclosed within the walls of the building (if a single structure) or added to an existing structure using various \\ntechniques to hide the coax cable and devices.  The non-passive devices within this category are designed to \\nensure that the signal distributed from the headend is of sufficient strength when it arrives at its final destination \\n\\n8 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nto  provide  high  quality  audio/video  images.    The  Company’s  HFC  Distribution  Products  accounted  for \\napproximately 15% and 14% of the Company’s revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. \\n\\n• \\nData Products give service providers, integrators, and premise owners a means to deliver data, video, \\nand  voice-over-coaxial  in  locations  such  as  hospitality,  MDU\\'s,  and  college  campuses  using  IP  technology.  \\nAmong the products offered by the Company are CMTS and CM. The Company’s Data Products accounted for \\napproximately 21% and 30% of the Company’s revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. \\n\\nOther Products. There are a variety of other products that the Company sells to a lesser degree, either \\n• \\nto fill a customer need or where sales have reduced due to changes in Company direction, technology, or market \\ninfluences.    Sales  of  products  in  these  categories  contributed  less  significantly  to  the  Company’s  revenues  in \\n2018 and 2017 and are expected to remain this way for 2019.  These products include:   \\n\\nTest instruments, for measuring both digital and analog CATV and Broadcast TV signals, as well as \\ncapture, analyze and/ or generate MPEG ASI transport streams. \\n\\nContract Manufacturing Services, providing manufacturing, research and development and product \\nsupport services for other companies’ products. \\n\\nReception  products  for  receiving  off-air  broadcast  television  and  satellite  transmissions  prior  to \\nheadend processing. \\n\\nTechnical Services, including hands-on training, system design engineering, on-site field support and \\ncomplete system verification testing. \\n\\nMiscellaneous  products  and  services,  filling  customers’  needs  for  satellite  distribution,  repair,  and \\nparts. \\n\\nThe Company will modify its products to meet specific customer requirements.  Typically, these modifications \\nare minor and do not materially alter either the product functionality or the ability to sell such altered products to other \\ncustomers.   \\n\\nResearch and Product Development \\n\\nThe markets served by Blonder Tongue are characterized by technological change, new product introductions, \\nand  evolving  industry  standards.    To  compete  effectively  in  this  environment,  the  Company  must  engage  in  ongoing \\nresearch and development in order to (i) create new products, (ii) expand features of existing products to accommodate \\ncustomer demand for greater capability, (iii) license new technologies, and (iv) acquire products incorporating technology \\nthat could not otherwise be developed quickly enough using internal resources.  Research and development projects are \\noften initially undertaken at the request of and in an effort to address the particular needs of the Company’s customers and \\ncustomer  prospects,  with  the  expectation  or  promise  of  substantial  future  orders.    Projects  may  also  result  from  new \\ntechnologies that become available, or new market applications of existing technology.  In the new product development \\nprocess, the vast experience of the Company’s Engineering Group is leveraged to ensure the highest level of suitability \\nand widest acceptance in the marketplace.  Products tend to be developed in a functional building block approach that \\nallows  for  different  combinations  of  blocks  to  generate  new  relevant  products.    Additional  research  and  development \\nefforts are also continuously underway for the purpose of enhancing product quality and lowering production costs.  For \\nthe acquisition of new technologies, the Company may rely upon technology licenses from third parties.  The Company \\nwill also license technology if it can obtain technology more quickly, or more cost-effectively from third parties than it \\ncould otherwise develop on its own, or if the desired technology is proprietary to a third party.  There were 17 employees \\nin the research and development department of the Company at December 31, 2018, including three employees located at \\nthe Company’s facility in Springboro, Ohio and four employees located at the Company’s facility in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. \\n\\nMarketing and Sales  \\n\\nBlonder Tongue markets and sells its products for use in a wide range of traditional and CIE markets, including \\ntraditional cable television, MDU, lodging/hospitality, and institutional (schools, hospitals and prisons).  The Company \\nalso sells into a multitude of niche CIE markets such as sports arenas and the cruise ship industry.  Sales are made directly \\nto customers by the Company’s internal sales force, as well as through Premier Authorized Stocking Distributors.  The \\nCompany instituted its Premier Distributor Program in 2007, through which a limited group of larger distributors who \\n\\n9 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nstock a significant amount of the Company’s products in their inventory (Premier Authorized Stocking Distributors) are \\ngiven access to a special purchase incentive program allowing them to achieve volume price concessions measured on a \\nyear-to-year basis.  Sales to Premier Authorized Stocking Distributors accounted for approximately 32% and 31% of the \\nCompany’s revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively.  These Premier Authorized Stocking Distributors serve multiple \\nmarkets.    Direct  sales  to  cable  operators  and  system  integrators  accounted  for  approximately  16%  and  10%  of  the \\nCompany’s revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively. \\n\\nThe Company’s sales and marketing function is performed predominantly by its internal sales force.  Should it be \\ndeemed necessary, the Company may retain independent sales representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to \\nspecific customer prospects or target market opportunities.  The Company’s internal sales force consists of 14 employees, \\nincluding four salespersons in Old Bridge, NJ, one salesperson in Round Rock, TX, one salesperson in Seminole, FL, one \\nsalesperson  in  Springboro,  OH,  one  salesperson  in  Peterborough,  Ontario,  Canada,  one  sales-support  person  in \\nSpringboro,  OH,  one  sales-support  person  in  Cape  Coral,  FL  and  four  sales-support  personnel  at  the  Company’s \\nheadquarters in Old Bridge, New Jersey.   \\n\\nThe  Company’s  standard  customer  payment  terms  are  net  30  days.    From  time  to  time,  when  circumstances \\nwarrant, such as a commitment to a large blanket purchase order, the Company will extend payment terms beyond its \\nstandard payment terms. \\n\\nThe  Company  has  several  marketing  programs  to  support  the  sale  and  distribution  of  its  products.    Blonder \\nTongue participates in industry trade shows and conferences and also maintains a robust website.  The Company publishes \\ntechnical articles in trade and technical journals, distributes sales and product literature and has an active public relations \\nplan  to  ensure  complete  coverage  of  Blonder  Tongue’s  products  and  technology  by  editors  of  trade  journals.    The \\nCompany provides system design engineering for its customers, maintains extensive ongoing communications with many \\noriginal equipment manufacturer customers and provides one-on-one demonstrations and technical seminars to potential \\nnew  customers.    Blonder  Tongue  supplies  sales  and  applications  support,  product  literature  and  training  to  its  sales \\nrepresentatives and distributors.  The management of the Company travels extensively, identifying customer needs and \\nmeeting potential customers. \\n\\nCustomers  \\n\\nBlonder Tongue has a diverse customer base, which in 2018 consisted of approximately 187 active accounts.  \\nApproximately  54%  and  63%  of  the  Company’s  revenues  in  2018  and  2017,  respectively,  were  derived  from  sales  of \\nproducts to the Company’s five largest customers.  World Cinema, Inc. and Toner Cable Equipment, Inc. accounted for \\napproximately  23%  and  14%,  respectively,  of  the  Company’s  revenues  in  2018  and  approximately  34%  and  13%, \\nrespectively, of the Company’s revenues in 2017.  None of these customers are obligated to purchase any specified amount \\nof products or to provide the Company with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period.  Accordingly, \\nthere can be no assurance that sales to these entities, individually or as a group, will reach or exceed historical levels in any \\nfuture period; however, the Company currently anticipates that Toner Cable Equipment, Inc. and World Cinema, Inc. will \\ncontinue to account for a significant portion of the Company’s revenues in future periods.  See disclosure below in “Risk \\nFactors  –  Any  substantial  decrease  in  sales  to  our  largest  customers  may  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations  or \\nfinancial condition” for further details. \\n\\nSince 2010, the Company has held multi-year contracts with key distributors in its Premier Distributor Program.  \\nThis program, which began in 2007, has been quite successful for the Company.  Many of the Company’s smaller business \\ncustomers, with whom the Company had formerly dealt on a direct basis, now purchase the Company’s products from \\nthese Premier Authorized Stocking Distributors. \\n\\nIn the Company’s direct sales to system integrators, the complement of leading customers tends to vary over time \\nas the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others.  Any substantial decrease or delay in \\nsales to one or more of the Company’s leading customers, the financial failure of any of these entities, or the Company’s \\ninability to develop and maintain solid relationships with the integrators that may replace the present leading customers, \\nwould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nThe Company’s revenues are derived primarily from customers in the continental United States; however, the \\nCompany also derives some revenues from customers in other geographical markets, primarily Canada and to a much \\nmore limited extent, in developing countries.  Sales to customers outside of the United States represented approximately \\n4% and 7% of the Company’s revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  All of the Company’s transactions with customers \\nlocated outside of the United States have historically been denominated in U.S. dollars.  As such, the Company has had no \\n\\n10 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nmaterial foreign currency transactions from which it derives revenues.  However, the Company derived certain relatively \\nlimited sales from customers located in Canada during 2018 and 2017 denominated in Canadian Dollars.  Transactions \\ndenominated in foreign currencies have certain inherent risks associated with them due to currency fluctuations.  See “Risk \\nFactors” below for more detail on the risks associated with foreign currency transactions.  \\n\\nManufacturing and Suppliers \\n\\nBlonder Tongue’s primary manufacturing operations are presently located at the Old Bridge Facility, which also \\nserves as the Company’s headquarters.  The Company has developed, implemented and maintains a Quality Management \\nSystem,  that  has  been  certified  as  conforming  to  all  requirements  of  the  ISO  9001:2015  international  standard.    The \\nCompany’s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the programming, assembly, and \\ntesting of electronic assemblies built from fabricated parts, printed circuit boards and electronic devices and the fabrication \\nfrom raw sheet metal, of chassis and cabinets for such assemblies.  Management continues to implement improvements to \\nthe manufacturing process to increase production volume and reduce product cost, including logistics modifications on the \\nfactory floor to accommodate increasingly fine pitch surface mount electronic components.  The Company is capable of \\nmanufacturing  assemblies  of  16  layer  printed  circuit  boards  with  thousands  of  components,  including  placement  of \\n0.030x0.030mil  ball  grid  arrays  and  0201  packaged  sized  components,  utilizing  its  advanced  state-of-the-art  automatic \\nplacement equipment as well as automated optical inspection and testing systems.  Investments by the Company in these \\nadvanced manufacturing technologies is consistent with and part of the Company’s strategy to provide its customers with \\nhigh  performance-to-cost  ratio  products.    The  Company  also  maintains  a  small  sales  and  engineering  facility  in \\nSpringboro, Ohio and maintains a small engineering facility in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. \\n\\nSince 2007, the Company has been manufacturing certain high volume, labor intensive products, including many \\nof the Company’s analog products, in the PRC.  A key contract manufacturer in the PRC produces such products (all of \\nwhich are proprietary Blonder Tongue designs) as may be requested by the Company from time to time (in the Company’s \\ndiscretion) through the submission of purchase orders, the terms of which are governed by a manufacturing agreement.  \\nAlthough the Company does not currently anticipate the transfer of any additional products to the PRC for manufacture, \\nthe  Company  may  do  so  if  business  and  market  conditions  make  it  advantageous  to  do  so.    In  connection  with  the \\nCompany’s initiatives in the PRC, the Company may have foreign currency transactions and may be subject to various \\ncurrency exchange control programs related to its PRC operations.  See “Risk Factors” below for more detail on the risk of \\nforeign operations. \\n\\nOutside  contractors  supply  standard  components,  printed  circuit  boards  and  electronic  subassemblies  to  the \\nCompany’s specifications.  While the Company generally purchases electronic parts that do not have a unique source, \\ncertain electronic component parts used within the Company’s products are available from a limited number of suppliers \\nand may be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions and the demand and supply for such \\ncomponent parts.  If the Company were to experience a temporary shortage of any given electronic part, the Company \\nbelieves that alternative parts could be obtained or system design changes implemented.  In such situations, however, the \\nCompany may experience temporary reductions in its ability to ship products affected by the component shortage.  On an \\nas-needed  basis,  the  Company  purchases  several  products  from  sole  suppliers  for  which  alternative  sources  are  not \\navailable.  An inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of certain of these components could have a material adverse \\neffect  on  the  Company’s  operating  results.    The  Company  does  not  have  an  agreement  with  any  sole  source  supplier \\nrequiring the supplier to sell a specified volume of components to the Company.  See “Risk Factors” below for more detail \\non the risk associated with sole supplier products.  \\n\\nBlonder Tongue maintains a quality assurance program which monitors and controls manufacturing processes, \\nand extensively tests samples throughout the process.  Samples of component parts purchased are tested, as well as its \\nfinished  products,  on  an  ongoing  basis.    The  Company  also  tests  component  and  sub-assemblies  throughout  the \\nmanufacturing  process  using  commercially  available  and  in-house  built  testing  systems  that  incorporate  proprietary \\nprocedures.  The highest level of quality assurance is maintained throughout all aspects of the design and manufacturing \\nprocess.  The extensive in-house calibration program assures test equipment integrity, correlation and calibration.  This \\nprogram ensures that all test and measurement equipment that is used in the manufacturing process is calibrated to the \\nsame  in-house  reference  standard  on  a  consistent  basis.    When  all  test  and  measurement  devices  are  calibrated  in  this \\nmanner,  discrepancies  are  eliminated  between  the  engineering,  manufacturing  and  quality  control  departments,  thus \\nincreasing operational efficiency and ensuring a high level of product quality.  Blonder Tongue performs final product \\ntests  prior  to  shipment  to  customers.    In  2008,  the  Company  was  certified  to  perform  Underwriters  Laboratories  (UL) \\nwitness testing of products to UL International Standard 60950.   \\n\\n11 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cCompetition \\n\\n \\n\\nAll aspects of the Company’s business are highly competitive.  The Company competes with national, regional \\nand local manufacturers and distributors, including companies larger than Blonder Tongue that have substantially greater \\nresources.  Various manufacturers who are suppliers to the Company sell directly as well as through distributors into the \\nfranchise and private cable marketplaces.  Because of the convergence of the cable, telecommunications and computer \\nindustries and rapid technological developments, new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the \\nCompany.  Many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, \\nsales and other resources than Blonder Tongue.  The Company expects that direct and indirect competition will increase in \\nthe  future.    Additional  competition  could  result  in  price  reductions,  loss  of  market  share  and  delays  in  the  timing  of \\ncustomer  orders.    The  principal  methods  of  competition  are  product  differentiation,  performance,  quality,  price,  terms, \\nservice, technical support and administrative support.  The Company believes it is a leader in many of the markets that it \\nserves and differentiates itself from competitors by consistently offering innovative products, providing excellent technical \\nservice support and delivering high performance-to-cost ratio products.   \\n\\nIntellectual Property \\n\\nThe Company currently holds several United States and foreign patents, none of which are considered material to \\nthe Company’s present operations, since they do not relate to high volume applications.  Because of the rapidly evolving \\nnature of the cable television industry, the Company believes that its market position as a supplier to cable integrators \\nderives  primarily  from  its  ability  to  timely  develop  a  consistent  stream  of  new  products  that  are  designed  to  meet  its \\ncustomers’ needs and that have a high performance-to-cost ratio. \\n\\nThe Company owns a United States trademark registration for the word mark “Blonder Tongue®” and also on a \\n\\n“BT®” logo.  Drake owns a United States trademark registration for the word mark “DRAKE®”.  \\n\\nSince 2008, the Company has obtained and renewed licenses for a variety of technologies in concert with its \\ndigital  encoder  line  of  products.    The  licenses  are  from  a  number  of  companies  including  LG  Electronics  (expires \\nDecember 2019).  These standard licenses are all non-exclusive and require payment of royalties based upon the unit sales \\nof  the  licensed  products.    With  regard  to  the  licenses  expiring  in  2019,  the  Company  expects  to  renew  these  standard \\nlicenses on similar terms to those presently in force.  For additional information regarding these licenses, see “Introduction \\n– Overview” starting on page 3. \\n\\nThe  Company  relies  on  a  combination  of  contractual  rights  and  trade  secret  laws  to  protect  its  proprietary \\ntechnologies and know-how.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to protect its technologies and \\nknow-how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know-how independently.  Therefore, \\nexisting and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with the Company’s products and \\nsuch  competition  could  adversely  affect  the  prices  for  the  Company’s  products  or  the  Company’s  market  share.    The \\nCompany  also  believes  that  factors  such  as  the  technological  and  creative  skills  of  its  personnel,  new  product \\ndevelopments,  frequent  product  enhancements,  name  recognition  and  reliable  product  maintenance  are  essential  to \\nestablishing  and  maintaining  its  competitive  position.    The  industries  in  which  the  Company  competes  are  subject  to \\nconstant  development  of  new  technologies  and  evolution  of  existing  technologies,  many  of  which  are  the  subject  of \\nexisting third party patents and new patents are issued frequently. \\n\\nRegulation \\n\\nPrivate cable, while in some cases subject to certain Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licensing \\nrequirements, is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 \\nderegulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators \\nand telephone companies in each of their respective industries.   \\n\\nEnvironmental Regulations \\n\\nThe Company is subject to a variety of Federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the storage, \\nuse, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes.  The \\nCompany did not incur in 2018 and does not anticipate incurring in 2019, material capital expenditures for compliance \\nwith Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  There can be no assurance, however, that changes in \\nenvironmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional \\nfinancial burdens on the Company.  Further, such regulations could restrict the Company’s ability to expand its operations.  \\n\\n12 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nAny failure by the Company to obtain required permits for, control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, \\nhazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the Company to substantial liability or could cause \\nits manufacturing operations to be suspended.   \\n\\nThe Company has authorization to discharge wastewater under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination \\nSystem/Discharge  to  Surface  Waters  General  Industrial  Stormwater  Permit,  Permit  No.  NJ0088315.    This  permit  will \\nexpire May 31, 2019.  The Company intends to renew this permit.  \\n\\nEmployees \\n\\nAs of February 28, 2019, the Company employed approximately 117 people, including 69 in manufacturing, 17 \\nin research and development, 4 in quality assurance, 16 in sales and marketing, and 11 in a general and administrative \\ncapacity.    Substantially  all  of  these  employees  are  full  time  employees.    Thirty-two  of  the  Company’s  employees  are \\nmembers of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, Local 2066, which has a labor agreement with the \\nCompany that is scheduled to expire in February 2023.  \\n\\nITEM 1A \\n\\nRISK FACTORS \\n\\nThe  Company’s  business  operates  in  a  rapidly  changing  environment  that  involves  numerous  risks,  some  of \\nwhich are beyond the Company’s control.  The following “Risk Factors” highlight some of these risks.  Additional risks \\nnot currently known to the Company or that the Company now deems immaterial may also affect the Company and the \\nvalue of its Common Stock.  The risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, \\nshould be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects.  The occurrence of any of the following risks \\ncould harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  \\n\\nAny  substantial  decrease  in  sales  to  our  largest  customers  may  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations  or \\nfinancial condition. \\n\\nApproximately  54%  and  63%  of  our  revenues  in  2018  and  2017,  respectively,  were  derived  from  sales  of \\nproducts  to  the  Company’s  five  largest  customers.    None  of  these  customers  are  obligated  to  purchase  any  specified \\namount  of  products  or  to  provide  the  Company  with  binding  forecasts  of  product  purchases  for  any  future  period.  \\nAccordingly,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  sales  to  these  entities,  individually  or  as  a  group,  will  reach  or  exceed \\nhistorical levels in any future period.  \\n\\nWith respect to our direct sales to system integrators, the complement of leading customers tends to vary over \\ntime as the most efficient and better-financed integrators grow more rapidly than others.  Our success with those customers \\nwill depend in part on: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nthe viability of those customers; \\nour ability to identify those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects; and \\nour ability to maintain our position in the overall marketplace by shifting our emphasis to such \\ncustomers.   \\n\\nIn  addition,  three  and  four  of  our  customers,  respectively  accounted  for  approximately  47%  and  65%  of  our \\noutstanding trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Any substantial decrease or delay in \\nsales to one or more of our leading customers, the financial failure of any of these entities, their inability to pay their trade \\naccounts owing to us, or our inability to develop solid relationships with integrators that may replace the present leading \\ncustomers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   \\n\\nAn inability to reduce expenses or increase revenues may cause continued net losses. \\n\\nWe have had losses each year since 2010, including a net loss of $1,416,000 for the year ended December 31, \\n2018.  While management believes its ongoing efforts to reduce expenses and increase revenues will improve profitability, \\nthere can be no assurance that these actions will be successful.  Failure to reduce expenses or increase revenues could have \\na material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n13 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nInventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventories may adversely affect our results of operations and financial \\ncondition. \\n\\nWe continually analyze our excess or obsolete inventories.  Based on historical and projected sales volumes and \\nanticipated selling prices, we establish reserves.  If we do not meet our sales expectations, these reserves are increased.  \\nProducts that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value.  Although we believe reserves are \\nadequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable value, there can be no assurance that we will not have to record \\nadditional inventory reserves in the future.  Significant increases to inventory reserves could have a material adverse effect \\non our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAn  inability  to  develop,  or  acquire  the  rights  to  technology,  products  or  applications  in  response  to  changes  in \\nindustry standards or customer needs may reduce our sales and profitability. \\n\\nBoth  the  private  cable  and  franchised  cable  industries  are  characterized  by  the  continuing  advancement  of \\ntechnology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs.  To be successful, we must anticipate the evolution \\nof industry standards and changes in customer needs, through the timely development and introduction of new products, \\nenhancement of existing products and licensing of new technology from third parties.  This is particularly true at this time \\nas  the  Company  must  develop  and  market  new  digital  products  to  offset  the  continuing  decline  in  demand  for,  and \\ntherefore  sales  of,  analog  products.    Although  we  depend  primarily  on  our  own  research  and  development  efforts  to \\ndevelop new products and enhancements to our existing products, we have and may continue to seek licenses for new \\ntechnology from third parties when we believe that we can obtain such technology more quickly and/or cost-effectively \\nfrom such third parties than we could otherwise develop on our own, or when the desired technology has already been \\npatented by a third party.  There can, however, be no assurance that new technology or such licenses will be available on \\nterms acceptable to us.  There can be no assurance that:  \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nwe will be able to anticipate the evolution of industry standards in the cable television or the \\ncommunications industry generally; \\nwe will be able to anticipate changes in the market and customer needs; \\ntechnologies and applications under development by us will be successfully developed; or  \\nsuccessfully developed technologies and applications will achieve market acceptance.   \\n\\nIf  we  are  unable  for  technological  or  other  reasons  to  develop  and  introduce  products  and  applications  or  to \\nobtain licenses for new technologies from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or \\ncustomer requirements, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.   \\n\\nAnticipated  increases  in  direct  and  indirect  competition  with  us  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of \\noperations and financial condition. \\n\\nAll aspects of our business are highly competitive.  We compete with national, regional and local manufacturers \\nand distributors, including companies larger than us, which have substantially greater resources.  Various manufacturers \\nwho are suppliers to us sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable television marketplace.  Because of the \\nconvergence  of  the  cable,  telecommunications  and  computer  industries  and  rapid  technological  development,  new \\ncompetitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by us.  Many of these potential competitors have significantly \\ngreater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than we have.  We expect that direct and \\nindirect competition will increase in the future.  Additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our results \\nof operations and financial condition through: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nprice reductions; \\nloss of market share;  \\ndelays in the timing of customer orders; and  \\nan inability to increase our penetration into the cable television market.   \\n\\nOur sales and profitability may suffer due to any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by the cable \\ninfrastructure operators that we serve in the MDU, lodging and institutional cable markets. \\n\\nThe  vast  majority  of  our  revenues  in  2018  and  2017  came  from  sales  of  our  products  for  use  by  cable \\ninfrastructure  operators.    Demand  for  our  products  depends  to  a  large  extent  upon  capital  spending  on  private  cable \\n\\n14 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0csystems and specifically by private cable operators for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading their systems.  \\nCapital spending by private cable operators and, therefore, our sales and profitability, are dependent on a variety of factors, \\nincluding:  \\n\\n \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\naccess by private cable operators to financing for capital expenditures; \\ndemand for their cable services; \\navailability of alternative video delivery technologies; and  \\ngeneral economic conditions.   \\n\\nIn addition, our sales and profitability may in the future be more dependent on capital spending by traditional \\nfranchise cable system operators as well as by new entrants to this market planning to over-build existing cable system \\ninfrastructures,  or  constructing,  rebuilding,  maintaining  and  upgrading  their  systems.    There  can  be  no  assurance  that \\nsystem  operators  in  private  cable  or  franchise  cable  will  continue  capital  spending  for  constructing,  rebuilding, \\nmaintaining,  or  upgrading  their  systems.    Any  substantial  decrease  or  delay  in  capital  spending  by  private  cable  or \\nfranchise cable operators would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   \\n\\nAdverse changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial \\ncondition. \\n\\nOur business and earnings are affected by general business, economic and financial markets conditions in the \\nUnited  States  and  elsewhere.    We  continue  to  operate  in  a  challenging  and  uncertain  economic  environment,  and  any \\nreturn to recessionary conditions or prolonged stagnant or deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the \\nmarkets in which we do business, the demand for our products, the ability of our customers to make payments to us in a \\ntimely fashion or at all, our ability and the ability of our customers to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and \\nother  potential  events  that  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of \\noperations.  Moreover, our stock price could remain depressed or decrease if investors have concerns that our business, \\nfinancial  condition  or  results  of  operations  will  be  negatively  impacted  by  a  worldwide  economic  downturn.    Other \\nuncertainties,  including  the  potential  effect  of  the  recently-announced  plans  for  the  United  States  to  impose  tariffs  on \\nimported steel and aluminum, which are important materials for the production of many of our products, could also have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   \\n\\nThe terms of our credit facility with Sterling Bank may restrict our current and future operating and financial \\nflexibility and could adversely affect our financial and operational results. \\n\\nOn  December  28,  2016,  the  Company,  entered  into  a  new  credit  facility  with  Sterling  National  Bank \\n(“Sterling”).  The Loan and Security Agreement between the Company and Sterling (the “Sterling Agreement”) includes \\na number of covenants that, among other things, may restrict our ability to: \\n\\nengage in mergers, consolidations, asset dispositions or similar fundamental changes; \\nredeem or repurchase shares of Company stock; \\ncreate, incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; \\ncreate, incur or permit liens on our assets;  \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n•  make loans or investments; \\n• \\n• \\n\\npay cash dividends or make similar distributions; and \\nchange the nature of our business. \\n \\n\\nThese restrictions in the Sterling Agreement may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions that could be \\nbeneficial  to  us  and  our  stockholders.    In  addition,  the  Sterling  Agreement  also  requires  us  to  meet  certain  financial \\ncovenants.  At December 31, 2018 and January 31, 2019, we were not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio \\ncovenant under the Sterling Agreement. Although Sterling has provided a waiver of this non-compliance, a failure by us to \\ncomply with the financial or other covenants under the Sterling Agreement in the future could result in an event of default, \\nan  inability  to  make  further  borrowings  under  the  Sterling  Agreement  or  a  termination  of  the  Sterling  Agreement  by \\nSterling.    In  connection  with  the  waiver  of  our  non-compliance,  we  have  entered  into  an  amendment  to  the  Sterling \\nAgreement that includes certain minimum liquidity requirements that will effectively reduce the amount we are able to \\nborrow, which could adversely affect our ability to fully fund our planned operations.  In the event of a default, Sterling \\ncould elect to declare all borrowings, accrued and unpaid interest and other fees outstanding, due and payable and require \\nus  to  use  available  cash  to  repay  these  borrowings,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  operations  and \\nfinancial condition.  If Sterling terminates the Sterling Agreement or further limits our ability to borrow under the Sterling \\n\\n15 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nAgreement as a result of any failures to comply with any covenants, or if we are unable to extend the Sterling Agreement \\nwhen the Sterling Facility matures in December 2019, we would seek new debt financing arrangements.  We cannot assure \\nyou  that  new  debt  financing  will  be  available  to  us  on  acceptable  terms  or  at  all.    In  addition,  new  debt  financing,  if \\navailable, could impose payment obligations, covenants and operating restrictions that are more onerous than under the \\nSterling Agreement, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. \\n\\n \\nAny significant casualty to our facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey may cause a lengthy interruption to our \\n\\nbusiness operations.   \\n\\nWe primarily operate out of one manufacturing facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey (the “Old Bridge Facility”).  \\nWhile we maintain a limited amount of business interruption insurance, a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of \\nour ability to manufacture at, or otherwise use, the Old Bridge Facility could have a material adverse effect on our results \\nof operations and financial condition.   \\n\\nOur dependence on certain third party suppliers could create an inability for us to obtain component products not \\notherwise available or to do so only at increased prices. \\n\\nWe purchase several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available.  Our results of \\n\\noperations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nan inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components; \\nour receipt of a significant number of defective components;  \\nan increase in component prices; or \\nour inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive pressures on the \\npricing of our products.   \\n\\nOur contract manufacturing in the PRC may subject us to the risks of unfavorable political, regulatory, legal and \\nlabor conditions in the PRC. \\n\\nWe manufacture and assemble some of our products in the PRC, under a contract manufacturing arrangement \\nwith  a  certain  key  Chinese  manufacturer.    Our  future  operations  and  earnings  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  risks \\nrelated to, or any other problems arising from, having our products manufactured in the PRC, including the following \\nrisks: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\npolitical, economic and labor instability;  \\nchanges in foreign or United States government laws and regulations, including exchange \\ncontrol regulations; \\nincreased costs related to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates; \\ninfringement of our intellectual property rights; and \\ndifficulties in managing foreign manufacturing operations. \\n\\nAlthough the PRC has a large economy, its potential economic, political, legal and labor developments entail \\nuncertainties  and  risks.    In  the  event  of  any  changes  that  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  manufacture  in  the  PRC  after \\nproducts have been successfully transitioned out of the United States, our business could suffer.  \\n\\nShifting our operations between regions may entail considerable expense. \\n\\nOver time we may shift additional portions of our manufacturing operations to the PRC in order to maximize \\nmanufacturing and operational efficiency.  This could result in reducing our domestic operations in the future, which in \\nturn could entail significant one-time earnings charges to account for severance, equipment write-offs or write downs and \\nmoving expenses. \\n\\n16 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nOur earnings would be reduced if our goodwill or intangible assets recorded as part of the Drake Acquisition were \\nto become impaired.  \\n\\nWe  recorded  goodwill  and  identifiable  intangible  assets  as  part  of  the  Drake  Acquisition  in  February  2012.  \\nGoodwill is generated when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible \\nassets acquired.  We also have certain intangible assets with indefinite lives.  We assess the impairment of goodwill and \\nindefinite lived intangible assets annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying \\nvalue may not be recoverable.  We assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other finite lived intangible assets \\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.  If our goodwill \\nor intangible assets recorded in connection with the Drake Acquisition were determined to be impaired, then we would be \\nrequired to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations \\nduring the period in which the impairment was recognized.  Any potential charges for impairment related to goodwill or \\nintangible assets would not impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity.  \\nWe may face risks relating to currency fluctuations and currency exchange.  \\n  \\nHistorically the Company has had limited exposure to currency fluctuations since transactions with customers \\nlocated outside the United States have generally been denominated in U.S. Dollars.  The Company incurs certain expenses \\nwhich are denominated in Canadian Dollars in connection with its sales and product distribution in Canada.  In addition, \\nthe Company incurs certain expenses denominated in Renminbi (“RMB”) in connection with its contract manufacturing \\nactivities in the PRC.  The Company\\'s functional currency is the U.S. Dollar.  Accordingly, any expense denominated in \\nCanadian Dollars or RMB needs to be translated into U.S. Dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in \\nour consolidated financial statements.  Exchange rates between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar and the RMB and \\nU.S.  Dollar  in  recent  years  have  fluctuated  significantly  and  may  do  so  in  the  future.    We  do  not  engage  in  currency \\nhedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations.  Currency fluctuations could adversely impact our results of \\noperations, cash flows and financial position.  \\n  \\nCompetitors  may  develop  products  that  are  similar  to,  and  compete  with,  our  products  due  to  our  limited \\nproprietary protection. \\n\\nWe possess limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to our technology.  We rely on a \\ncombination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and know-how.  There can be \\nno assurance that we will be able to protect our technology and know-how or that third parties will not be able to develop \\nsimilar technology independently.  Therefore, existing and potential competitors may be able to develop similar products \\nwhich compete with our products.  Such competition could adversely affect the prices for our products or our market share \\nand could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nPatent  infringement  claims  against  us  or  our  customers,  whether  or  not  successful,  may  cause  us  to  incur \\nsignificant costs. \\n\\nWhile we do not believe that our products (including products and technologies licensed from others) infringe \\nvalid intellectual property rights of any third parties, there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or \\nclaims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted against us or our customers.  Damages \\nfor infringement of valid intellectual property rights of third parties could be substantial, and if determined to be willful, \\ncan be trebled.  Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of \\noperation.  Regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims, we could incur significant costs and \\ndiversion  of  resources  with  respect  to  the  defense  thereof  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial \\ncondition and results of operations.  If we are unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against us \\nor our customers, we could seek to obtain a license under a third party’s intellectual property rights.  There can be no \\nassurance, however, that under such circumstances, a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all.  The \\nfailure to obtain a license to a third party’s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  \\n\\nAny increase in governmental regulation of the markets that we serve, including the cable television system, MDU, \\nlodging and institutional markets, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nThe cable television, MDU, lodging and institutional markets within the cable industry, which represents the vast \\nmajority of our business, while in some cases subject to certain FCC licensing requirements, is not presently burdened \\nwith  extensive  government  regulations.    It  is  possible,  however,  that  regulations  could  be  adopted  in  the  future  which \\nimpose burdensome restrictions on these markets resulting in, among other things, barriers to the entry of new competitors \\n\\n17 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nor limitations on capital expenditures.  Any such regulations, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our results \\nof operations and financial condition. \\n\\nPrivate cable system operation is not presently burdened with significant government regulation, other than, in \\nsome cases, certain FCC licensing and signal leakage requirements.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 deregulated \\nmany  aspects  of  franchise  cable  system  operation  and  opened  the  door  to  competition  among  cable  operators  and \\ntelephone  companies  in  each  of  their  respective  industries.    It  is  possible,  however,  that  regulations  could  be  adopted \\nwhich would re-impose burdensome restrictions on franchise cable operators resulting in, among other things, the grant of \\nexclusive rights or franchises within certain geographical areas.  Any increased regulation of franchise cable could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nAny  increase  in  governmental  environmental  regulations  or  our  inability  or  failure  to  comply  with  existing \\nenvironmental regulations may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. \\n\\nWe  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  federal,  state  and  local  governmental  regulations  related  to  the  storage,  use, \\ndischarge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes.  We do \\nnot anticipate material capital expenditures during 2019 for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws \\nand regulations.  There can be no assurance, however, that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need \\nfor additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on us.  Further, such regulations could \\nrestrict  our  ability  to  expand  our  operations.    Any  failure  by  us  to  obtain  required  permits  for,  control  the  use  of,  or \\nadequately  restrict  the  discharge  of,  hazardous  substances  under  present  or  future  regulations  could  subject  us  to \\nsubstantial  liability  or  could  cause  our  manufacturing  operations  to  be  suspended.    Such  liability  or  suspension  of \\nmanufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nLosing  the  services  of  our  executive  officers  or  our  other  highly  qualified  and  experienced  employees,  or  our \\ninability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced employees, could adversely affect our \\nbusiness.   \\n\\nOur  future  success  depends  in  large  part  on  the  continued  service  of  our  key  executives  and  technical  and \\nmanagement personnel.  Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled \\nengineering, manufacturing, marketing and managerial personnel.  The competition for such personnel is intense, and the \\nloss of key employees, in particular the principal members of our management and technical staff, could have a material \\nadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   \\n\\nOur  organizational  documents  and  Delaware  state  law  contain  provisions  that  could  discourage  or  prevent  a \\npotential takeover or change in control of our company or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for \\ntheir shares of our Common Stock. \\n\\nOur  board  of  directors  has  the  authority  to  issue  up  to  5,000,000  shares  of  undesignated  Preferred  Stock,  to \\ndetermine the powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon \\nany  unissued  series  of  undesignated  Preferred  Stock  and  to  fix  the  number  of  shares  constituting  any  series  and  the \\ndesignation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders.  The Preferred Stock could be issued \\nwith  voting,  liquidation,  dividend  and  other  rights  superior  to  the  rights  of  the  Common  Stock.    Furthermore,  such \\nPreferred  Stock  may  have  other  rights,  including  economic  rights,  senior  to  the  Common  Stock,  and  as  a  result,  the \\nissuance of such stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock.  In addition, our \\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\neliminates the right of our stockholders to act without a meeting;  \\ndoes not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors; \\ndoes not provide our stockholders with the right to call special meetings; \\nprovides for a classified board of directors; and \\nimposes various procedural requirements which could make it difficult for our stockholders to \\neffect certain corporate actions.   \\n\\nThese  provisions  and  the  Board’s  ability  to  issue  Preferred  Stock  may  have  the  effect  of  deterring  hostile \\ntakeovers or offers from third parties to acquire the Company, preventing our stockholders from receiving a premium for \\ntheir shares of our Common Stock, or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company.  We are \\nalso afforded the protection of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could: \\n\\n18 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\ndelay or prevent a change in control of the Company;  \\nimpede a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us; or \\ndiscourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain \\ncontrol of the Company.   \\n\\nAny  of  these  provisions  which  may  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  preventing  a  change  in  control  of  the \\n\\nCompany, could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our Common Stock. \\n\\nIt is unlikely that we will pay dividends on our Common Stock. \\n\\nWe currently intend to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business and therefore do not intend to pay \\ndividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.  Moreover, the Sterling Agreement prohibits the payment of \\ncash dividends by us on our Common Stock. \\n\\nOur Common Stock is thinly traded and subject to volatility, which may adversely affect the market price for our \\nCommon Stock. \\n\\n \\nAlthough  our  Common  Stock  is  traded  on  the  NYSE  American,  it  may  remain  relatively  illiquid,  or  “thinly \\ntraded,” which can increase share price volatility and make it difficult for investors to buy or sell shares in the public \\nmarket without materially affecting the quoted share price.  Investors may be unable to buy or sell a certain quantity of our \\nshares in the public market within one or more trading days.  If limited trading in our stock continues, it may be difficult \\nfor holders to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices.  \\n\\nThe prevailing market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, \\n\\nsome of which are beyond our control, including the following: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us, our competitors or third \\nparties; \\nquarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations;  \\nfailure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community’s \\nexpectations; \\nmarket conditions for cable industry stocks in general; \\n\\nbroader market trends unrelated to our performance; and \\n\\nsales of significant amounts of our Common Stock by our officers and directors or the \\nperception that such shares may occur. \\n\\n \\nThe uncertainties we face relating to our liquidity and ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations \\nand to continue to operate our business as a going concern also contributes to the volatility of our stock price, and any \\ninvestment in our Common Stock could suffer a significant decline or total loss in value.  Furthermore, we may not be able \\nto maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American LLC or any other national securities \\nexchange or over-the-counter market on which our Common Stock is then traded, which may also adversely affect the \\ntrading price of our Common Stock. \\n\\nOur share ownership is highly concentrated.  \\n\\nOur directors and officers beneficially own, or have the right to vote, in the aggregate, approximately 52% of our \\nCommon  Stock  and  will  continue  to  have  significant  influence  over  the  outcome  of  all  matters  submitted  to  the \\nstockholders for approval, including the election of our directors.  \\n\\nDelays  or  difficulties  in  negotiating  a  labor  agreement  or  other  difficulties  in  our  relationship  with  our  union \\nemployees may cause an adverse effect on our manufacturing and business operations. \\n\\nAll of our direct labor employees located at the Old Bridge, New Jersey facility are members of the International \\nBrotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers  Union,  Local  2066  (the  “Union”),  under  a  collective  bargaining  agreement,  which \\nexpires in February 2023.  In connection with any renewal or renegotiation of the labor agreement upon its termination, \\n\\n19 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nthere  can  be  no  assurance  that  work  stoppages  will  not  occur  or  that  we  will  be  able  to  agree  upon  terms  for  future \\nagreements with the Union.  Any work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results \\nof operations and financial condition. \\n\\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches. \\n\\nAttempts  by  others  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  information  technology  systems  are  becoming  more \\nsophisticated.  Our systems are designed to detect security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we \\nmight be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.  While we have not identified any material incidents of \\nunauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property, confidential business or \\npersonal information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development \\nand other strategic initiatives, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  In addition, to the extent \\nthat any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential \\nand /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach.  \\nWe could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices \\nrelated to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection. \\n\\nIncreased tariffs or other trade actions could adversely affect our business. \\n\\n \\nThere is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with \\nrespect to trade policies and tariffs.  We source a variety of finished products and component parts from China.  Although \\nwe  currently  believe  that  most  of  those  products      are  not  subject  to  tariffs,  we  cannot  assure  you  that  governmental \\nauthorities will agree with that position or that future actions may be taken by the United States or China to impose tariffs \\non those products and components or otherwise affect our ability to source those products and components, which could \\nhave an adverse effect on our future operations.  In addition, certain of the products we obtain from China are currently \\nsubject to tariffs.  Although we do not expect that the currently-applicable tariffs will have an adverse effect on our results \\nof operations, we have raised prices on certain products to attempt to offset the effect of those tariffs, and we are also \\nconsidering  alternative  sources  of  supply  from  manufacturers  in  other  countries  and  moving  certain  manufacturing \\nactivities to our Old Bridge facility as additional ways to mitigate the effect of those tariffs.  If our expectations regarding \\nthe effect of the currently-applicable tariffs prove to be incorrect and we are unable to offset or mitigate the effects of \\nthose tariffs, our future operating results may be adversely affected. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nITEM 1B. \\n\\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS \\n\\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. \\n\\nITEM 2. \\n\\nPROPERTIES \\n\\nThe Company’s principal manufacturing, engineering, sales and administrative facilities consist of one building \\ntotaling approximately 130,000 square feet located on approximately 20 acres of land in Old Bridge, New Jersey (the “Old \\nBridge Facility”) which currently is owned by the Company.  As discussed in further detail below, the Company has sold  \\nthe Old Bridge Facility and leased back a substantial portion of the premises.  The Old Bridge Facility was encumbered by \\na  mortgage  held  by  Sterling  National  Bank,  securing  the  obligations  of  the  Company  to  Sterling  under  the  Sterling \\nAgreement, which includes the principal amount of $3,053,000 under the term loan portion of the Sterling Agreement as \\nof  December  31,  2018,  and  by  a  mortgage  held  by  the  Subordinated  Lenders  (defined  in  Item  7  below)  securing  the \\nSubordinated Loan Facility (defined in Item 7 below) in the principal amount of up to $750,000, of which $100,000 (plus \\naccrued unpaid interest) is outstanding as of December 31, 2018.  The mortgages were released in connection with the \\nCompany’s  repayments  of  amounts  due  under  the  Sterling  Agreement  and  the  Subordinated  Loan  Facility,  which \\nrepayments  occurred  upon  the  closing  of  the  sale  of  the  Old  Bridge  Facility.    In  addition,  the  Company  leases  an \\nengineering and sales facility consisting of one building totaling approximately 7,500 square feet in Springboro, Ohio.  \\nThe lease for this facility expires in October, 2021.  The total lease obligation for the Springboro, Ohio facility will be \\napproximately  $49,000  during  2019.    Further,  the  Company  leases  an  engineering  facility  consisting  of  one  building \\ntotaling approximately 2,400 square feet in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  The lease for this facility expires in May, 2020.  The \\ntotal  lease  obligation  for  the  Fort  Wayne,  Indiana  facility  will  be  approximately  $38,000  during  2019.    Management \\nbelieves that these facilities are adequate to support the Company’s anticipated needs in 2019.  \\n\\n20 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nOn February 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the Old Bridge Facility to Jake Brown Road, LLC (the \\n“Buyer”). In addition, in connection with the completion of the sale, the Company and the Buyer (as landlord) entered \\ninto  a  lease  (the  “Lease”),  pursuant  to  which  the  Company  will  continue  to  occupy,  and  continue  to  conduct  its \\nmanufacturing, engineering, sales and administrative functions in the Old Bridge Facility. \\n  \\n\\nThe sale of the Old Bridge Facility was made pursuant to an Agreement of Sale dated as of August 3, 2018 (the \\n“Initial Sale Agreement”), as amended by an Extension Letter Agreement dated as of September 20, 2018, the Second \\nAmendment to Agreement of Sale dated as of October 8, 2018 and the Third Amendment to Agreement of Sale dated as of \\nJanuary  30,  2019  (the  Initial  Sale  Agreement  together  with  the  Extension  Letter  Agreement,  Second  Amendment  to \\nAgreement of Sale and Third Amendment to Agreement of Sale, collectively, the “Sale Agreement”). Pursuant to the Sale \\nAgreement, at closing, Buyer paid the Company $10,500,000. In addition, at closing, the Company advanced to the Buyer \\nthe sum of $130,000, representing a preliminary estimate of the Company’s share (as a tenant of the Old Bridge Facility \\nfollowing  closing)  of  property  repairs,  as  contemplated  by  the  Sale  Agreement.   The  Company  recognized  a  gain  of \\n$7,909,000 in connection with the sale. \\n  \\n\\nAs previously disclosed, the Lease will have an initial term of five years and allows the Company to extend the \\nterm for an additional five years following the initial term. The Company is obligated to pay base rent of $836,855.50 for \\nthe first year of the Lease, with the amount of the base rent adjusted for each subsequent year to equal 102.5% of the \\npreceding year’s base rent. \\n\\n \\n\\nITEM 3. \\n\\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS \\n\\nThe Company is a party to certain proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of its business, none of which, in \\nthe opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, \\nresults of operations or cash flows.  \\n\\nITEM 4. \\n\\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES \\n\\nNot applicable. \\n\\nPART II \\n\\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND \\n\\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \\n\\nTrading Market \\n\\nThe Company’s Common Stock has been traded on the NYSE American (formerly the NYSE MKT) since the \\nCompany’s initial public offering on December 14, 1995.  The Company’s Common Stock is traded under the symbol \\n“BDR”. \\n\\nAs of March 15, 2019, the Company had 79 holders of record of the Common Stock.  Since a portion of the \\nCompany’s Common Stock is held in “street” or nominee name, the Company is unable to determine the exact number of \\nbeneficial holders. \\n\\nDividends \\n\\nThe Company currently anticipates that it will retain all of its earnings to finance the operation of its business, \\nand therefore does not intend to pay dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future.  Since its initial public \\noffering, the Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock.  Any determination to pay \\ndividends in the future is at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon the Company’s \\nfinancial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, limitations contained in loan agreements and such other \\nfactors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.  The Sterling Agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends by the \\nCompany on its Common Stock.  \\n\\n21 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cShare Repurchases \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  July  24,  2002,  the  Company  commenced  a  stock  repurchase  program  to  acquire  up  to  $300,000  of  its \\noutstanding  Common  Stock  (the  “2002  Program”).    On  February  13,  2007,  the  Company  announced  a  new  stock \\nrepurchase  program  to  acquire  up  to  an  additional  100,000  shares  of  its  outstanding  Common  Stock  (the  “2007 \\nProgram”).  As of December 31, 2018, the Company can purchase up to $72,000 of its Common Stock under the 2002 \\nProgram and up to 100,000 shares of its Common Stock under the 2007 Program.  The Company may, in its discretion, \\ncontinue  making  purchases  under  the  2002  Program  up  to  its  limits,  and  thereafter  to  make  purchases  under  the  2007 \\nProgram.    The  Sterling  Agreement  currently  prohibits  the  Company  from  repurchasing  shares  of  its  Common  Stock, \\nwhether  under  the  2002  Program  and  the  2007  Program  or  otherwise.    During  2018  and  2017,  the  Company  did  not \\npurchase any of its Common Stock under the 2002 Program or the 2007 Program.   \\n\\nITEM 6. \\n\\nSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA \\n\\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. \\n\\nITEM 7. \\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND \\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\n\\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company’s historical results of operations and liquidity and capital \\nresources  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company  and  notes  thereto \\nappearing elsewhere herein.  The following discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements that involve \\nrisks  and  uncertainties.    Our  actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  those  anticipated  in  these  forward-looking \\nstatements as a result of various factors.  See “Forward Looking Statements” that precedes Item 1 above. \\n\\nOverview \\n\\nThe Company was incorporated in November 1988, under the laws of Delaware as GPS Acquisition Corp. for \\nthe purpose of acquiring the business of Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, which was founded \\nin  1950  by  Ben  H.  Tongue  and  Isaac  S.  Blonder  to  design,  manufacture  and  supply  a  line  of  electronics  and  systems \\nequipment principally for the private cable industry.  Following the acquisition, the Company changed its name to Blonder \\nTongue  Laboratories,  Inc.    The  Company  completed  the  initial  public  offering  of  its  shares  of  Common  Stock  in \\nDecember 1995. \\n\\nToday,  the  Company  is  a  technology-development  and  manufacturing  company  that  delivers  a  wide  range  of \\nproducts and services to the cable entertainment and media industry.  For over 65 years, Blonder Tongue/Drake products \\nhave been deployed in a long list of locations, including lodging/hospitality, multi-dwelling units/apartments, broadcast \\nstudios/networks, universities/schools, healthcare/hospitals, fitness centers, government facilities/offices, prisons, airports, \\nsports stadiums/arenas, entertainment venues/casinos, retail stores, and small-medium businesses. These applications are \\nvariously described as commercial, institutional and/or enterprise environments and will be referred to herein collectively \\nas  “CIE”.    The  customers  we  serve  include  business  entities  installing  private  video  and  data  networks  in  these \\nenvironments, whether they are the largest cable television operators, telco or satellite providers, integrators, architects, \\nengineers or the next generation of Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) streaming video providers.  The technology \\nrequirements of these markets change rapidly and the Company’s research and development team is continually delivering \\nhigh performance-lower cost solutions to meet customers’ needs. \\n\\nThe  Company’s  strategy  is  focused  on  providing  a  wide  range  of  products  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  CIE \\nenvironments described above, including lodging/hospitality, multi-dwelling units/apartments, broadcast studios/networks, \\nuniversities/schools,  healthcare/hospitals,  fitness  centers,  government  facilities/offices,  prisons,  airports,  sports \\nstadiums/arenas, entertainment venues/casinos, retail stores, and small-medium businesses, and to provide offerings that \\nare optimized for an operator’s existing infrastructure, as well as the operator’s future strategy.  A key component of this \\ngrowth strategy is to provide products that deliver the latest technologies (such as IPTV and digital SD and HD video \\ncontent) and have a high performance-to-cost ratio.   \\n\\nThe Company has seen a continuing shift in product mix from analog products to digital products and expects \\nthis  shift  to  continue.    Accordingly,  any  substantial  decrease  in  sales  of  analog  products  without  a  related  increase  in \\ndigital products could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash \\nflows.    Sales  of  digital  video  headend  products  were  $10,494,000  and  $9,438,000  and  sales  of  analog  video  headend \\nproducts were $1,661,000 and $1,819,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.   \\n\\n22 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nThe  Company’s  manufacturing  is  allocated  primarily  between  its  facility  in  Old  Bridge,  New  Jersey  (“Old \\nBridge Facility”) and a key contract manufacturer located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).  The Company \\ncurrently  manufactures  most  of  its  digital  products,  including  the  latest  encoder  and  EdgeQAM  collections  at  the  Old \\nBridge  Facility.    Since  2007  the  Company  has  transitioned  and  continues  to  manufacture  certain  high  volume,  labor \\nintensive products, including many of the Company’s analog products, in the PRC, pursuant to a manufacturing agreement \\nthat governs the production of products that may from time to time be the subject of purchase orders submitted by (and in \\nthe  discretion  of)  the  Company.    Although  the  Company  does  not  currently  anticipate  the  transfer  of  any  additional \\nproducts to the PRC for manufacture, the Company may do so if business and market conditions make it advantageous to \\ndo so. Manufacturing products both at the Company’s Old Bridge Facility as well as in the PRC, enables the Company to \\nrealize cost reductions while maintaining a competitive position and time-to-market advantage.  \\n\\nThe Company may, from time to time, provide manufacturing, research and development and product support \\nservices  for  other  companies’  products.    In  2015,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  VBrick  Systems,  Inc. \\n(“VBrick”) to provide procurement, manufacturing, warehousing and fulfillment support to VBrick for a line of high end \\nencoder products and sub-assemblies.  Sales to VBrick of encoder products were approximately $791,000 and $840,000 in \\n2018 and 2017, respectively.  Sales to VBrick for sub-assemblies were not material in 2018 or 2017. \\n\\nResults of Operations \\n\\nThe following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, certain consolidated statement of earnings data as \\n\\na percentage of net sales.   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nNet sales ...........................................................................  \\nCosts of goods sold ..........................................................  \\nGross profit .......................................................................  \\nSelling expenses ...............................................................  \\nGeneral and administrative expenses ...............................  \\nResearch and development expenses ...............................  \\n(Loss) earnings from operations .......................................  \\nOther expense, net ............................................................  \\nLoss before income taxes .................................................  \\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes ................................  \\nNet loss………………………………………………….. \\n\\n \\n\\n2018 Compared with 2017 \\n\\nYear Ended December 31, \\n    2018 \\n\\n    2017 \\n\\n \\n\\n100.0% \\n61.2 \\n38.8 \\n11.3 \\n19.5 \\n11.9 \\n(3.9) \\n2.6 \\n(6.5) \\n(0.1) \\n(6.4) \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n100.0% \\n61.6 \\n38.4 \\n10.7 \\n15.2 \\n10.5 \\n2.0 \\n3.7 \\n(1.7) \\n(0.1) \\n(1.6) \\n\\nNet  Sales.  Net  sales  decreased  $1,576,000  or  6.8%  to  $21,707,000  in  2018  from  $23,283,000  in  2017.    The \\ndecrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of data products offset, in part, by an increase in sales of digital \\nvideo  headend  products.    Sales  of  data  products  were  $4,583,000  and  $6,942,000  and  sales  of  digital  video  headend \\nproducts were $10,494,000 and $9,438,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Company has experienced and expects to \\ncontinue to experience a shift in product mix from analog products to digital products. \\n\\nCost  of  Goods  Sold.  Cost  of  goods  sold  decreased  to  $13,288,000  in  2018  from  $14,347,000  in  2017  and \\ndecreased as a percentage of sales to 61.2% from 61.6%. The dollar decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in \\nsales.    The  decrease  as  a  percentage  of  sales  is  attributable  to  a  more  favorable  product  mix,  as  sales  of  digital  video \\nheadend  products  comprised  a  greater  percentage  of  sales  in  2018.    The  Company  expects  cost  of  goods  sold  as  a \\npercentage of sales to go up during 2019. \\n\\nSelling Expenses. Selling expenses decreased to $2,461,000 in 2018 from $2,492,000 in 2017 and increased as a \\npercentage of sales to 11.3% for 2018 from 10.7% for 2017.  This $31,000 decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease \\nin commissions of $48,000, a decrease in freight expense of $46,000, a decrease advertising and trade show expenses of \\n$43,000 and a decrease in royalty expense of $32,000 offset by an increase in salaries and fringe benefits of $101,000 and \\nincrease in department supplies of $43,000.   The increase as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to decrease in \\nnet sales.  The Company expects that expenses in this area, as a percentage of revenue, will decrease slightly during 2019. \\n\\n23 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nGeneral  and  Administrative  Expenses.  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  to  $4,236,000  in  2018 \\nfrom $3,529,000 in 2017 and increased as a percentage of sales to 19.5% for 2018 from 15.2% in 2017.  This $707,000 \\nincrease was primarily the result of an increase in professional fees of $383,000, an increase in salaries and fringe benefits \\nof $212,000 due to salary increases and an increase in headcount, an increase in directors’ fees of $93,000 and an increase \\nin  travel  and  entertainment  expenses  of  $85,000  offset  by  a  recovery  of  bad  debt  of  $126,000.    The  increase  as  a \\npercentage of sales is attributable to the overall increase as well as a decrease in net sales.  The Company expects that \\nexpenses in this area, as a percentage of revenue, will decrease slightly during 2019. \\n\\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expenses increased to $2,576,000 in 2018 from \\n$2,452,000 in 2017and increased as a percentage of sales to 11.9% in 2018 from 10.5% in 2017.  This $124,000 increase \\nis primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and fringe benefits of $129,000 due to an increase in headcount and \\nsalary increase and an increase in engineering prototypes of $83,000 offset by a decrease in license fees of $112,000.  The \\nincrease as a percentage of sales is attributable to the overall increase as well as a decrease in net sales.  The Company \\nexpects that expenses in this area, as a percentage of revenue, will decrease slightly during 2019. \\n\\nOperating  (loss)  Income.    Operating  loss  of  $(854,000)  for  2018  represents  a  reduction  from  the  operating \\nincome of $463,000 in 2017.  Operating (loss) income as a percentage of sales decreased to (3.9)% in 2018 from 2.0% in \\n2017 for reasons discussed above.   \\n\\nInterest  expense.  Interest  expense  decreased  to  $562,000  in  2018  from  $723,000  in  2017.    The  decrease  is \\nprimarily the result of the accretion of the debt discount related to the former derivative liability of $177,000 relating to the \\nsubordinated convertible debt during 2017. The Company expects interest expense to significantly decrease during 2019 \\ndue to the payoff of debt in connection with the sale of the Old Bridge Facility. \\n\\nIncome  Taxes.    The  benefit  for  income  taxes  was  $(77,000)  in  2018  and  $(18,000)  in  2017.    The  Company \\nrecords a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are no longer considered to be realizable.  The decrease \\nin  the  2018  provision  is  attributable  to  a  decrease  in  the  deferred  tax  provision  related  to  decrease  in  the  valuation \\nallowance. The significant negative evidence supporting the full valuation allowance includes a loss for the current year, a \\ncumulative pre-tax loss for the three years ended December 31, 2018, the inability to carryback the net operating losses, \\nlimited  future  reversals  of  existing  temporary  differences  and  the  limited  availability  of  tax  planning  strategies.    The \\nCompany expects to continue to provide a full valuation allowance until, or unless, it can sustain a level of profitability \\nthat demonstrates its ability to utilize these assets. \\n\\nInflation and Seasonality \\n\\nInflation and seasonality have not had a material impact on the results of operations of the Company.  Fourth \\nquarter  sales  in  2018  as  compared  to  other  quarters  were  slightly  impacted  by  fewer  production  days.    The  Company \\nexpects sales each year in the fourth quarter to be impacted by fewer production days. \\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \\n\\nAs of December31,2018, the Company’s working capital was $2,114,000. As of February 28, 2019, upon closing \\nthe sale of the building and the payoff of the debt as described below, the Company had a cash balance of approximately \\n$2,479,000. \\n\\nThe Company’s net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $587,000, \\nprimarily  due  to  an  increase  in  accounts  payable  and  accrued  expenses  of  $1,376,000  and    non-cash  expenses  of \\n$1,090,000 offset by a net loss of $1,339,000 and an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $503,000, compared to \\nnet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $237,000, primarily due to a reduction in \\naccounts payable and accrued expenses of $711,000, a net loss of $384,000 and an increase in accounts receivable of \\n$348,000 offset by non-cash expenses of $1,538,000. \\n\\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $101,000, which was attributable \\nprimarily to capital expenditures of $81,000 and the acquisition of licenses of $20,000. Cash used in investing activities \\nfor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017  was  $200,000,  which  was  attributable  primarily  to  capital  expenditures  of \\n$138,000 and the acquisition of licenses of $62,000. \\n\\nCash used in financing activities was $95,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, comprised primarily of \\nrepayments of debt of $251,000 offset by net borrowings on the line of credit of $116,000 and proceeds from the exercise \\n\\n24 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nof stock options of $40,000.  Cash provided by financing activities was $137,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, \\ncomprised primarily of net borrowings on the line of credit of $367,000 offset by repayments of debt of $230,000. \\n\\nFor  a  full  description  of  the  Company’s  senior  secured  indebtedness  under  the  Sterling  Facility  and  the \\nCompany’s  senior  subordinated  convertible  indebtedness  under  the  Subordinated  Loan  Facility,  and  their  respective \\neffects upon the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations, see Note 5 – Debt and Note 6 – \\nSubordinated Convertible Debt with Related Parties of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\nThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity have been its existing cash balances, cash generated from operations \\nand amounts available under the Sterling Facility and the Subordinated Loan Facility. In connection with the completion \\nof the sale of the Old Bridge Facility, as described below, the Subordinated Loan Facility was terminated.  On a going-\\nforward basis, the Company expects its primary sources of liquidity will be its existing cash balances (including amounts \\nthe Company received upon completion of the sale of the Old Bridge Facility, as described below), cash generated from \\noperations and amounts available under the Sterling Facility.  The Company was not in compliance with the fixed charge \\ncoverage ratio under the Sterling Agreement at December 31, 2018 and January 31, 2019.  Sterling has waived this non-\\ncompliance,  and  the  Company  and  Sterling  have  agreed  to  an  amendment  to  the  Sterling  Agreement  (the  “Second \\nAmendment”),  which  replaced  the  existing  fixed  charge  coverage  ratio  covenant  with  a  minimum  liquidity  covenant.  \\nThat covenant obligates us to not permit the sum of our unrestricted cash (as described in the Second Amendment) plus \\navailability under the Revolver to drop below $2,000,000 at any time.  The Company had approximately $654,000 and \\nestimates  that  it  had  approximately  $448,000  of  additional  availability  for  borrowing  under  the  Revolver,  as  well  as \\n$250,000 and zero of additional availability for borrowing under the Subordinated Loan Facility as of December 31, 2018 \\nand March 31, 2019, respectively.   The minimum liquidity covenant will effectively reduce the amount we are able to \\nborrow  under  the  Sterling  Facility.    The  Sterling  Facility  matures  in  December  2019.   We  curr ently  intend  to  seek  to \\nextend the Sterling facility, but if we are unable to do so, we would seek new debt financing arrangements.  We cannot \\nassure you that new debt financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. \\n \\n\\nAs discussed in Item 2 – Properties, on February 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the Old Bridge \\nFacility to Jake Brown Road, LLC (the “Buyer”). In addition, in connection with the completion of the sale, the Company \\nand the Buyer (as landlord) entered into a lease (the “Lease”), pursuant to which the Company will continue to occupy, \\nand continue to conduct its manufacturing, engineering, sales and administrative functions in the Old Bridge Facility. \\n\\n \\nThe sale of the Old Bridge Facility was made pursuant to an Agreement of Sale dated as of August 3, 2018 (the \\n“Initial Sale Agreement”), as amended by an Extension Letter Agreement dated as of September 20, 2018, the Second \\nAmendment to Agreement of Sale dated as of October 8, 2018 and the Third Amendment to Agreement of Sale dated as of \\nJanuary  30,  2019  (the  Initial  Sale  Agreement  together  with  the  Extension  Letter  Agreement,  Second  Amendment  to \\nAgreement of Sale and Third Amendment to Agreement of Sale, collectively, the “Sale Agreement”). Pursuant to the Sale \\nAgreement, at closing, Buyer paid the Company $10,500,000. In addition, at closing, the Company advanced to the Buyer \\nthe sum of $130,000, representing a preliminary estimate of the Company’s share (as a tenant of the Old Bridge Facility \\nfollowing closing) of property repairs, as contemplated by the Sale Agreement.  \\n\\n \\nIn connection with the completion of the sale of the Old Bridge Facility and entry into the Lease, the Company, \\nR. L. Drake Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“RLD”) and Blonder Tongue Far East, LLC, a \\nwholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company  (“Far  East,”    and  together  with  the  Company  and  RLD,  collectively  the \\n“Credit  Parties”) entered into a Consent Under Loan and Security Agreement (the “Consent”) with Sterling National \\nBank (as lender and as administrative agent, “Sterling”).  The Consent relates to the Loan and Security Agreement (the \\n“Loan Agreement”) entered into by the Credit Parties and Sterling on December 28, 2016.  Under the terms of the Loan \\nAgreement, Sterling’s consent was required in order for the Company to complete the sale of the Old Bridge Facility.  In \\naddition to providing Sterling’s consent to the sale, the Consent requires Sterling to execute and deliver a Discharge of \\nMortgage  and  Assignment  of  Leases  and  Rents  (the  “Discharge”)  to  effect  the  discharge  of  Sterling’s  interests  in  the \\nProperty  (as  defined  in  the  Consent)  originally  granted  to  Sterling  in  the  Mortgage,  Assignment  of  Leases  and  Rents, \\nSecurity Agreement, Fixture Filing and Financing Statement entered into in connection with the Loan Agreement. The \\nCompany paid approximately $3,014,000 to pay off the Term Loan in connection with the Discharge.  In addition, the \\nCompany paid off the outstanding balance under the Revolver of approximately $2,086,000. \\n\\n \\nOn January 24, 2019, the Company and RLD  (with the Company, collectively, the “Borrower”) entered into a \\nDebt Conversion and Lien Termination Agreement (the “Conversion and Termination Agreement”) with Robert J. Pallé \\n(“RJP”) and Carol M. Pallé (collectively, “Initial Lenders”), and Steven L. Shea and James H. Williams (collectively, the \\n“Supplemental  Lenders,”  and  together  with  the  Initial  Lenders,  collectively,  the  “Lenders”),  and  Robert  J.  Pallé,  as \\nAgent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the “Agent”).   \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nAs  previously  disclosed,  the  Borrower,  the  Lenders  and  the  Agent  were  parties  to  a  First  Amendment  to \\nAmended and Restated Senior Subordinate Convertible Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of March 21, 2017 (as \\namended  to  date,  the  “Subordinated  Loan  Agreement”),  pursuant  to  which  the  Lenders  provided  the  Borrower  with \\ncommitments  to  lend  Borrower  up  to  $750,000  in  the  form  of  loans  convertible,  under  the  terms  provided  in  the \\nSubordinated Loan Agreement, into shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The obligations of Borrower to pay, satisfy \\nand discharge the obligations under the Subordinated Loan Agreement were secured by security interests in and liens upon \\ncertain  specified  collateral,  including  certain  mortgages  in  favor  of  the  Lenders  and  the  Agent  (the  “Subordinated \\nMortgages,” and together with the Subordinated Loan Agreement and all other agreements, documents and instruments \\nrelated thereto, collectively, the “Subordinated Loan Documents”). \\n\\n \\nAs of the date of the Conversion and Termination Agreement, the Borrower was indebted to Steven L. Shea \\n(“Shea”) for the principal and accrued interest relating to a $100,000 loan advanced by Shea under the Subordinated Loan \\nAgreement (the “Shea  Indebtedness”).  In addition, as of the date of the Conversion and Termination Agreement the \\nInitial  Lenders  remained  subject  to  a  commitment  to  lend  Borrowers  up  to  an  additional  $250,000  (the  “Additional \\nCommitment”). \\n\\n \\nIn  connection  with  the  completion  of  the  sale  of  the  Old  Bridge  Facility,  the  Borrower,  the  Lenders  and  the \\nAgent  entered  into  the  Conversion  and  Termination  Agreement  to  provide  for  (i)  the  full  payment  of  the  Shea \\nIndebtedness (unless such amounts were converted into shares of Common Stock prior to repayment), (ii) the termination \\nof the Additional Commitment and (iii) the release and termination of all liens and security interests in the collateral under \\nthe Subordinated Loan Documents, including with respect to the Subordinated Mortgages, each to become effective as of \\nthe closing of the sale of the Old Bridge Facility.  In connection with the execution and delivery of the Conversion and \\nTermination  Agreement  by  the  Borrower,  the  Lenders  and  the  Agent,  Shea  provided  the  Company  with  a  notice  of \\nconversion, and upon completion of the sale of the Old Bridge Facility was issued 259,983 shares of Company Common \\nStock in full satisfaction of the Shea Indebtedness.  \\n\\n \\nAs previously disclosed, the Lease will have an initial term of five years and allows the Company to extend the \\nterm for an additional five years following the initial term. The Company is obligated to pay base rent of $836,855.50 for \\nthe first year of the Lease, with the amount of the base rent adjusted for each subsequent year to equal 102.5% of the \\npreceding year’s base rent. Without regard to any reduction in the Company’s lease expense derived from its sublease to a \\nthird party of the Sublease Space (defined below), for the first year of the Lease, the base rent of $836,855.00 would \\noffset, in part, the anticipated annualized saving of interest and depreciation expense of approximately $469,000 and the \\ncash debt service of approximately $562,000. The Lease further provides for a security deposit in an amount equal to eight \\nmonths of base rent, which may be reduced to three months of base rent upon certain benchmarks being met. The landlord \\nmay, once during the lease term or any renewal thereof, require the Company to relocate to another facility made available \\nby the landlord that meets the Company’s specifications for a replacement facility within a defined geographical area, by \\nproviding notice which confirms that all of the Company’s specifications for a replacement facility will be met, that all \\ncosts relating to such relocation will be paid by the landlord, and that security for the repayment of those relocation costs \\nhas  been  established.  The  Company  will  also  be  provided  a  six  month  overlap  period  (the  “Overlap  Period”)  during \\nwhich the Company may operate in the Old Bridge Facility with rent therein being abated, but with rent being paid at the \\nreplacement facility, to mitigate interruptions of the Company’s on-going business while the move occurs. If the Company \\ndeclines to be relocated to the facility proposed by the landlord, the Lease will terminate 18 months from the date of the \\nlandlord’s notice, but the Company will continue to be entitled to receive the same benefits in terms of reimbursement of \\nits relocation costs and an Overlap Period during which no rent will be due at the Old Bridge Facility, while the Company \\nmoves its operations to an alternative facility that it has identified. \\n\\nThe Company anticipates subleasing to a third party up to 40,000 square feet of the Old Bridge Facility (the \\n“Sublease Space”), the rental proceeds from which will inure to the benefit of the Company. The Company’s ability to \\nsublease all or part of the Sublease Space, the specific terms of any sublease of the Sublease Space and the amount of rent \\nthat will be derived therefrom cannot be predicted at this time. The landlord will provide the Company with up to six \\nmonths of free rent for the Sublease Space, as the Company undertakes to identify a suitable tenant or tenants therefor. \\n\\nThe Company’s primary long-term obligations are for payment of interest and principal on the Sterling Facility, \\nwhich  expires  on  December  28,  2019.    The  Company  expects  to  use  cash  generated  from  operations  and  the  Sale \\nAgreement proceeds to meet its long-term debt obligations.  The Company also expects to make financed and unfinanced \\nlong-term  capital  expenditures  from  time  to  time  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  which  capital  expenditures  were \\n$81,000 and $138,000 in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Company expects to use cash \\ngenerated from operations, amounts available under the Sterling Facility, proceeds from the Sale Agreement and purchase-\\nmoney financing to meet any anticipated long-term capital expenditures.  \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nThe Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to sustain its planned operations for at \\n\\nleast the next 12 months from the filing date of this Form 10-K. \\n\\nCritical Accounting Estimates \\n\\nThe Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in \\nthe United States.  Preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the \\nCompany to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of \\ncontingent  assets  and  liabilities  as  of  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and \\nexpenses  during  the  reporting  period.    The  following  paragraphs  include  a  discussion  of  some  critical  areas  where \\nestimates are required.  You should also review Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of \\nsignificant accounting policies. \\n\\nInventory and Obsolescence \\n\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method, or net realizable \\n\\nvalue.   \\n\\nThe  Company  periodically  analyzes  anticipated  product  sales  based  on  historical  results,  current  backlog  and \\nmarketing plans.  Based on these analyses, the Company anticipates that certain products will not be sold during the next \\ntwelve months.  Inventories that are not anticipated to be sold in the next twelve months, have been classified as non-\\ncurrent.   \\n\\nThe Company continually analyzes its slow-moving and excess inventories.  Based on historical and projected \\nsales volumes and anticipated selling prices, the Company establishes reserves.  Inventory that is in excess of current and \\nprojected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates its estimate of future demand.  Products that are \\ndetermined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value.   \\n\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \\n\\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms.  The Company sells its products \\nprimarily  to  distributors  and  private  cable  operators.    The  Company  performs  continuing  credit  evaluations  of  its \\ncustomers’ financial condition and although the Company generally does not require collateral, letters of credit may be \\nrequired from its customers in certain circumstances.   \\n\\nSenior  management  reviews  accounts  receivable  on  a  monthly  basis  to  determine  if  any  receivables  will \\npotentially  be  uncollectible.    The  Company  includes  any  accounts  receivable  balances  that  are  determined  to  be \\nuncollectible, along with a general reserve based on historical experience, in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts.   \\n\\nLong-Lived Assets \\n\\nThe Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of \\nthe long-lived assets, including intangible assets may not be recoverable.  When such events or changes in circumstances \\noccur, the Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered \\nthrough the undiscounted expected future cash flows.  If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying \\namount of these assets, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of \\nthe assets.  The Company did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in 2018 and 2017, respectively. \\n\\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets \\n\\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of the FASB ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes”.  \\nDeferred  income  taxes  are  provided  for  temporary  differences  in  the  recognition  of  certain  income  and  expenses  for \\nfinancial and tax reporting purposes.  Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to \\nthe amount expected to be realized. \\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \\n\\nSee financial statement pages 45-46. \\n \\n\\n27 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nITEM 7A. \\n\\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK \\n\\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. \\n\\nITEM 8. \\n\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \\n\\nIncorporated by reference from the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company, which \\n\\nare attached hereto beginning on page 35. \\n\\nITEM 9. \\n\\nCHANGES  IN  AND  DISAGREEMENTS  WITH  ACCOUNTANTS  ON  ACCOUNTING  AND \\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE \\n\\nNot applicable.  \\n\\nITEM 9A. \\n\\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \\n\\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \\n\\nThe  Company  maintains  a  system  of  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  designed  to  provide  reasonable \\nassurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted pursuant to Rules 13a-\\n15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  “Exchange  Act”),  is  recorded,  processed, \\nsummarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  rules  and  forms  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange \\nCommission.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure \\nthat such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive \\nofficer  and  principal  financial  officer,  as  appropriate,  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.    The \\nCompany  carried  out  an  evaluation,  under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  management,  including  the \\nprincipal  executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer,  of  the  design  and  operation  of  the  Company’s  disclosure \\ncontrols  and  procedures  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report.    Based  on  this  evaluation,  the  Company’s \\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures \\nwere effective at December 31, 2018. \\n\\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting \\n\\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \\nfinancial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.  The Company’s internal control over \\nfinancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and \\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted \\nin the United States of America. \\n\\nAll  internal  control  systems,  no  matter  how  well  designed,  have  inherent  limitations.    Therefore,  even  those \\nsystems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation \\nand presentation. \\n\\nThe  Company’s  management  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial \\nreporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, it used the 2013 criteria set forth by the Committee of \\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on \\nthis  assessment the  Company believes  that,  as  of  December  31,  2018  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial \\nreporting is effective based on those criteria.  \\n\\nThis  annual  report  does  not  include  an  attestation  report  of  the  Company\\'s  registered  public  accounting  firm \\nregarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\\'s report was not subject to attestation by the Company\\'s \\nregistered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Smaller Reporting \\nCompanies that permit the Company to provide only management\\'s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\n\\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2018, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over \\nfinancial  reporting  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the  Company’s  internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting. \\n\\n28 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cITEM 9B. \\n\\nOTHER INFORMATION \\n\\n \\n\\nNot applicable.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPART III \\n\\nITEM 10. \\n\\nDIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE \\n\\nThe  information  about  the  Company’s  directors  and  executive  officers  is  incorporated  by  reference  from  the \\ndiscussion under the heading “Directors and Executive Officers” in the Company’s proxy statement for its 2018 Annual \\nMeeting  of  Stockholders.

In our opinion, the financial statements present \\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of \\nits operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with \\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \\n\\nBasis for Opinion \\n \\nThese  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company\\'s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an \\nopinion on the Company\\'s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the \\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect \\nto  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\n \\nWe  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and \\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, \\nwhether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its \\ninternal  control  over  financial  reporting.  As  part  of  our  audits  we  are  required  to  obtain  an  understanding  of  internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\'s \\ninternal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  \\n \\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether \\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a \\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating \\nthe  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall \\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\n \\n \\n/S/ Marcum LLP \\n \\nMarcum LLP \\n \\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005. \\n \\nNew York, NY \\nApril 1, 2019 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n36 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nThe Company and Basis of Consolidation \\n\\nBlonder  Tongue  Laboratories,  Inc.  (together  with  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  the  “Company”)  is  a  technology-\\ndevelopment and manufacturing company that delivers television signal encoding, transcoding, digital transport, and broadband \\nproduct solutions to the markets the Company serves, including the multi-dwelling unit market, the lodging/hospitality market \\nand the institutional market, including hospitals, prisons and schools, primarily throughout the United States and Canada. The \\nconsolidated financial statements include the accounts of Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  \\nSignificant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents \\n\\nThe Company considers all highly liquid debt investments with a maturity of less than three months at purchase to be \\ncash equivalents.  The Company did not have any cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 and 2017.  Cash balances at financial \\ninstitutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).  At times, cash and cash equivalents may be \\nuninsured  or  in  deposit  accounts  that  exceed  the  FDIC  insurance  limit.    Periodically,  the  Company  evaluates  the \\ncreditworthiness of the financial institutions and evaluates its credit exposure.   \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful accounts \\n\\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms.  The Company sells its products primarily \\nto distributors and private cable operators.  The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial \\ncondition and although the Company generally does not require collateral, letters of credit may be required from its customers in \\ncertain circumstances.   \\n\\nSenior management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be \\nuncollectible.  The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a \\ngeneral reserve based on historical experience, in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts.   \\n\\n(d) \\n\\nInventories \\n\\nInventories  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost,  determined  by  the  first-in,  first-out  (“FIFO”)  method,  or  net  realizable \\n\\nvalue.   \\n\\nThe  Company  periodically  analyzes  anticipated  product  sales  based  on  historical  results,  current  backlog  and \\nmarketing plans.  Based on these analyses, the Company anticipates that certain products will not be sold during the next twelve \\nmonths.  Inventories that are not anticipated to be sold in the next twelve months, have been classified as non-current.   \\n\\nThe Company continually analyzes its slow-moving and excess inventories.  Based on historical and projected sales \\nvolumes and anticipated selling prices, the Company establishes reserves.  Inventory that is in excess of current and projected \\nuse is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates its estimate of future demand.  Products that are determined to be \\nobsolete are written down to net realizable value.   \\n\\n(e) \\n\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation generally on the straight-line \\nmethod based upon estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years for office equipment, 5 to 7 years for furniture and fixtures, 6 to 10 \\nyears  for  machinery  and  equipment,  10  to  15  years  for  building  improvements  and  40  years  for  the  manufacturing  and \\nadministrative office facility. \\n\\n41 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(f) \\n\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \\n\\nThe  Company  accounts  for  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  in  accordance  with  Accounting  Standards  Codification \\n(“ASC”) ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“ASC 350”).  ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other \\nintangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that \\nthe fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. \\n\\nGoodwill  represents  the  excess  of  the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  business \\ncombinations.  Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires that goodwill be tested for \\nimpairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and \\nbetween annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt.  \\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets \\nand liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value.  Significant judgment is \\nrequired to estimate the fair value of reporting units including estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount \\nrates and other assumptions.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value \\nand/or goodwill impairment.  \\n\\nThe Company’s business includes one goodwill reporting unit.  The Company annually reviews goodwill for possible \\nimpairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the assets.  If the fair value exceeds the \\ncarrying value of the net asset, no goodwill impairment is deemed to exist.  If the fair value does not exceed the carrying value, \\ngoodwill is tested for impairment and written down to its implied fair value if it is determined to be impaired. The Company \\nperformed its annual goodwill impairment test on December 31, 2018.  Based upon its qualitative assessment, the Company \\ndetermined that goodwill was not impaired. \\n\\nThe  Company  considers  its  trade  name  to  have  an  indefinite  life  and  in  accordance  with  ASC  350,  will  not  be \\n\\namortized and will be reviewed annually for impairment. \\n\\nThe components of intangible assets that are carried at cost less accumulated amortization at December 31, 2018 are as \\n\\nfollows: \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nThe components of intangible assets that are carried at cost less accumulated amortization at December 31, 2017 are as \\n\\nfollows: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDescription \\n\\n \\nCustomer relationships \\nProprietary technology \\nNon-compete agreements \\nAmortized intangible assets \\nNon-Amortized Trade name \\nTotal \\n\\nDescription \\n\\n \\nCustomer relationships \\nProprietary technology \\nNon-compete agreements \\nAmortized intangible assets \\nNon-Amortized Trade name \\nTotal \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nCost \\n\\n$1,365 \\n349 \\n248 \\n1,962 \\n741 \\n$2,703 \\n\\nCost \\n\\n$1,365 \\n349 \\n248 \\n1,962 \\n741 \\n$2,703 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAccumulated \\nAmortization \\n\\n \\n$944 \\n242 \\n248 \\n1,434 \\n- \\n$1,434 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nNet Amount \\n\\n \\n$  421 \\n107 \\n- \\n528 \\n741 \\n$1,269 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAccumulated \\nAmortization \\n\\n \\n$808 \\n206 \\n248 \\n1,262 \\n- \\n$1,262 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nNet Amount \\n\\n \\n$  557 \\n143 \\n- \\n700 \\n741 \\n$1,441 \\n\\n42 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nAmortization is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 10 years for customer \\nrelationships,  10  years  for  proprietary  technology,  and  3  years  for  non-compete  agreements.    Amortization  expense  for \\nintangible assets was $171 for both years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Intangible asset amortization is \\nprojected to be approximately $171 per year in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively and $15 in 2022.   \\n\\n(g) \\n\\nLong-Lived Assets \\n\\nThe Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of the \\nlong-lived assets, including intangible assets may not be recoverable.  When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the \\nCompany  assesses  recoverability  by  determining  whether  the  carrying  value  of  such  assets  will  be  recovered  through  the \\nundiscounted  expected  future  cash  flows.    If  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  are  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  these \\nassets,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  based  on  the  excess  of  the  carrying  amount over  the  fair  value  of  the  assets.    The \\nCompany did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in 2018 and 2017. \\n\\n (h) \\n\\nTreasury Stock \\n\\nTreasury Stock is recorded at cost.  Gains and losses on subsequent reissuance are recorded as increases or decreases \\nto additional paid-in capital with losses in excess of previously recorded gains charged directly to retained earnings.  During \\n2018 and 2017, 81 shares and 92 shares, respectively of common stock were reissued from treasury.  \\n\\n(i) \\n\\nSignificant Risks and Uncertainties \\n\\nThe  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and \\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date \\nof the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The Company’s \\nsignificant estimates include stock compensation and reserves related to accounts receivable, inventory and deferred tax assets.  \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. \\n\\nAt  December  31,  2018,  approximately  28%  of  the  Company’s  employees  were  covered  by  a  collective  bargaining \\n\\nagreement, that is scheduled to expire in February 2023. \\n\\nThe  Company’s  digital  video  headend  products  accounted  for  approximately  48%  and  41%  of  the  Company’s \\n\\nrevenues in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.   \\n\\n(j) \\n\\nRoyalty and License Expense \\n\\nThe Company records royalty expense, as applicable, when the related products are sold.  Royalty expense is recorded \\nas a component of selling expenses.  Royalty expense was $45 and $77 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, \\nrespectively.  The Company amortizes license fees over the life of the relevant contract.   \\n\\nThe  components  of  intangible  assets  consisting  of  license  agreements  that  are  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated \\n\\namortization are as follows: \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nLicense agreements \\nAccumulated amortization \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2018 \\n\\n \\n\\n  $6,005 \\n(5,993) \\n$   12 \\n\\nDecember 31, \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n43 \\n\\n2017 \\n\\n \\n\\n  $5,985 \\n(5,956) \\n$   29 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAmortization of license fees is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 1 to 2 \\nyears.  Amortization expense for license fees was $38 and $150 in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \\nAmortization expense for license fees is projected to be approximately $12 in the year ending December 31, 2019. \\n\\n(k) \\n\\nForeign Exchange \\nThe  Company  uses  the  United  States  dollar  as  its  functional  and  reporting  currency  since  the  majority  of  the \\nCompany’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are in the United States and the focus of the Company’s operations is in \\nthat  country.    Assets  and  liabilities  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  using  the  exchange  rate  at  the  balance  sheet  date. \\nRevenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year. Gains and losses from foreign currency \\ntransactions and translation for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and cumulative translation gains and losses as of \\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017 were not material.   \\n\\n(l) \\n\\n \\nResearch and Development \\n\\nResearch and development expenditures for the Company’s projects are expensed as incurred. \\n\\n(m) \\n\\nRevenue Recognition \\n\\nThe Company generates revenue through the sale of products and services.   \\n\\nRevenue is recognized based on the following steps: (i) identification of contract with customer; (ii) determination of \\nperformance obligations; (iii) measurement of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance \\nobligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. \\n\\nRevenue from the sale of products and services is recorded when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually at the \\ntime of shipment or when the service is provided, at the net sales price (transaction price).  Estimates of variable consideration, \\nsuch as volume discounts and rebates, are reviewed and revised periodically by management.  The Company elected to present \\nrevenue net of sales tax and other similar taxes and account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs rather than \\nseparate  performance  obligations.    Payments  are  typically  due  in  30  days,  following  delivery  of  products  or  completion  of \\nservices. The Company provides a three-year warranty on most products.  Warranty expense was de minimis in the two years \\nended December 31, 2018. \\n\\n (n) \\n\\nStock-based compensation \\n\\nThe Company computes stock-based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance.  The Company uses the \\nBlack-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options.  The Black-Scholes-Merton option-\\npricing model includes various assumptions, including the fair market value of the common stock of the Company, expected life \\nof stock options, the expected volatility and the expected risk-free interest rate, among others.  These assumptions reflect the \\nCompany’s best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of \\nthe Company. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. \\n\\nAs a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation cost, as determined in accordance with \\nauthoritative guidance, could have been materially impacted.  Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions on future \\ngrants, stock-based compensation cost could be materially affected in future periods. \\n\\n (o) \\n\\nIncome Taxes \\n\\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) \\nASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes” (“ASC  Topic  740”).  Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the \\nrecognition of certain income and expenses for financial and tax reporting purposes.  Valuation allowances are established when \\nnecessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. \\n\\n44 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe Company will classify as income tax expense any interest and penalties recognized in accordance with ASC Topic \\n740.    The  Company  files  income  tax  returns  primarily  in  the  United  States  and  New  Jersey,  along  with  certain  other \\njurisdictions. \\n\\n(p) \\n\\nEarnings (loss) Per Share \\n\\nEarnings (loss) per share are calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260 “Earnings Per Share,” which provides for \\nthe calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings (loss) per share.  Basic earnings (loss) per share includes no dilution and is \\ncomputed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted \\nearnings (loss) per share reflect, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the effect of potential issuances of common \\nshares.  The diluted share base excludes incremental shares related to stock options, warrants and convertible debt of 1,157. 100 \\nand 257 and 1,256, 100 and 1,156 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  These shares were excluded \\ndue to their antidilutive effect. \\n\\n(q) \\n\\nOther Comprehensive Income (loss) \\nComprehensive income (loss) is a measure of income which includes both net loss and other comprehensive income \\n(loss).  Other comprehensive income (loss) results from items deferred from recognition into the statement of operations and \\nprincipally consists of unrecognized pension losses net of taxes.  Accumulated other comprehensive loss is separately presented \\non the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet as part of stockholders’ equity. \\n\\n(r)  \\n\\nSubsequent Events \\n\\nThe Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are \\nissued.    Based  upon  the  evaluation,  the  Company  did  not  identify  any  additional  recognized  or  non-recognized  subsequent \\nevents that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\n(s) \\n\\nAdoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements \\n\\nOn  January  1,  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update  (“ASU”)  No.  2014-09,  Revenue  from \\nContracts with Customers (“Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method.  Under the modified retrospective method, \\nthe Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening \\nbalance of retained earnings. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while \\nprior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under \\nRevenue  Recognition  (“Topic  605”).    The  adoption  of  Topic  606  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s  \\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \\n\\n \\nIn  May  2017,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2017-09,  Compensation–Stock  Compensation  (Topic  718):  Scope  of \\nModification  Accounting,  clarifying  when  a  change  to  the  terms  or  conditions  of  a  share-based  payment  award  must  be \\naccounted for as a modification. The new guidance requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the \\nclassification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award.  The \\nnew  guidance  was  effective  for  the  Company  on  a  prospective  basis  beginning  on  January  1,  2018,  with  early  adoption \\npermitted. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or financial \\nstatement disclosure. \\n\\n(t) \\n\\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective \\n\\nIn  June  2018,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2018-07,  Compensation  –  Stock  Compensation  (“Topic  718”): \\nImprovements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance in this ASU expands the scope of ASC Topic \\n718 to include all share-based payment arrangements related to the acquisition of goods and services from both nonemployees \\nand  employees.  This  amendment  will  be  effective  for  annual  and  interim  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2018.  The \\nCompany  does  not  believe  the  adoption  of  ASU  2018-07  will  have  a  material  effect  on  its  financial  position,  results  of \\noperations or financial statement disclosure.  \\n\\n \\n\\n45 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which establishes a new lease accounting \\nmodel  for  lessees.  The  updated  guidance  requires  an  entity  to  recognize  assets  and  liabilities  arising  from  a  lease  for  both \\nfinancing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. In June 2018, the FASB issued \\nASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which further clarifies how to apply certain aspects of the \\nnew  lease  standard.    In  July  2018,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2018-11,  Leases  –  Targeted  Improvements,  which  provides \\nanother transition method that allows entities to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-\\neffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.  This transition method option is in \\naddition to the existing transition method of using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered \\ninto after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Topic 842 is effective for fiscal \\nyears, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company \\nadopted Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective approach as applied to leases existing as of or entered into \\nafter  the  adoption  date.  Topic  842  provides  a  number  of  optional  practical  expedients  and  accounting  policy  elections.  The \\nCompany elected the package of practical expedients requiring no reassessment of whether any expired or existing contracts are \\nor contain leases, the lease classification of any expired or existing leases, or initial direct costs for any existing leases. The \\nCompany is in the final process of implementing a new lease accounting policy and updating its controls and procedures for \\nmaintaining and accounting for its lease portfolio under the new guidance. Upon adoption of Topic 842, the Company expects \\nrecognition  of  additional  assets  and  corresponding  liabilities  pertaining  to  its  operating  leases  on  its  balance  sheets.  The \\nCompany expects to recognize approximately $290 of a right to use asset and liability under current operating leases at January \\n1, 2019.  The Company expects to recognize approximately $3,627 of a right to use asset and liability in connection with the \\nlease described in Note 16. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a significant impact on its \\nresults of operations and cash flows. \\n\\n \\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (“Topic 350”) Simplifying the Test \\nfor Goodwill Impairment.  This standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment.  The guidance removes Step 2 of \\nthe goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.  Goodwill impairment will now be the \\namount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.  The \\nrevised guidance will be applied prospectively and is effective for calendar year-end SEC filers for its annual or any interim \\ngoodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual \\ngoodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect this \\nnew standard will have on its financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosure. \\n\\n \\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (“Topic \\n220”): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"ASU 2018-02\"). ASU 2018-\\n02  provides  financial  statement  preparers  with  an  option  to  reclassify  stranded  tax  effects  within  accumulated  other \\ncomprehensive income to retained earnings in each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income \\ntax rate in the Tax Reform (or portion thereof) is recorded.  ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December \\n15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any interim period for which financial statements have not been issued.  The Company \\ndoes  not  believe  that  the  adoption  of  this  guidance  will  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company\\'s  consolidated  financial \\nstatements due the presence of a full valuation allowance.   \\n\\n \\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326).  ASU 2016-13 \\nchanges the impairment model for most financial assets, and will require the use of an expected loss model in place of the \\ncurrently used incurred loss method. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on \\nsuch instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation \\nof the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The update to the standard is effective for interim and annual \\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on its \\nfinancial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosure. \\n \\nNote 2 - Revenue \\n\\nThe Company recognized revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring the product or service to \\n\\nthe customer, typically at a point in time. \\n\\nDisaggregation of Revenue \\n\\n46 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe following table presents the Company’s disaggregated revenues by revenue source: \\n\\n \\n \\nDigital video headend products \\nData products \\nHFC distribution products \\nAnalog video headend products \\nContract manufactured products \\nOther \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nYears ended December 31, \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n$  9,438 \\n \\n6,942 \\n \\n3,343 \\n \\n1,819 \\n \\n \\n838 \\n             903 \\n  $  23,283 \\n\\n \\n  $  10,494 \\n \\n4,583 \\n3,217 \\n \\n1,661 \\n \\n \\n791 \\n             961 \\n  $  21,707 \\n\\n \\nAll of the Company’s sales are to customers located in North America. \\nThe Company is a technology-development and manufacturing company that delivers a wide range of products and \\nservices  to  the  cable  entertainment  and  media  industry.

The  Sterling  Agreement  provides  the  Company  with  a  credit  facility  in  an  aggregate \\namount of $8,500 (the “Sterling Facility”) consisting of a $5,000 asset-based revolving line of credit (the “Revolver”) and a \\n$3,500 amortizing term loan (the “Term Loan”).  The Sterling Facility matures in December 2019.  Interest on the Revolver is \\nvariable, based upon the 30-day LIBOR rate (2.52% and 1.56% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively) plus a margin of \\n4.00%.  Interest on the Term Loan also is variable, based upon the 30-day LIBOR rate (2.52% and 1.56% at December 31, 2018 \\nand 2017, respectively) plus a margin of 4.50%.  The Term Loan will amortize at the rate of $19 per month.  On March 30, \\n2017,  the  Company  and  Sterling  entered  into  a  certain  First  Amendment  to  Loan  and  Security  Agreement  (the  “First \\nAmendment”),  pursuant  to  which,  among  other  things,  the  parties  amended  the  definitions  of  certain  items  used  in  the \\ncalculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio, deferred the first measurement period of the financial covenants contemplated by \\nthe  Sterling  Agreement,  from  December  31,  2016  to  January  31,  2017,  and  modified  certain  terms  relating  to  permitted \\ninvestments by the Company.  On March 29, 2019, the Company and Sterling entered into a certain Second Amendment to \\nLoan and Security Agreement (the “Second Amendment”), which replaced the existing fixed charge coverage ratio covenant \\nwith a minimum liquidity covenant.  That covenant obligates the Company to not permit the sum of its unrestricted cash (as \\ndescribed  in  the  Second  Amendment)  plus  availability  under  the  Revolver  to  drop  below  $2,000,000  at  any  time.  The \\noutstanding balances under the Revolver were $2,603 and $2,487 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  All outstanding \\nindebtedness under the Sterling Agreement is secured by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. \\n\\nThe  Sterling  Agreement  contains  customary  covenants,  including  restrictions  on  the  incurrence  of  additional \\nindebtedness, encumbrances on the Company’s assets, the payment of cash dividends or similar distributions, the repayment of \\nany  subordinated  indebtedness  and  the  sale  or  other  disposition  of  the  Company’s  assets.  In  addition,  the  Company  must \\nmaintain (i) the minimum liquidity described above and (ii) a leverage ratio of not more than 2.0 to 1.0 for any fiscal month \\n(determined  as  of  the  last  day  of  each  fiscal  month,  as  calculated  for  the  Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries).    The \\nCompany was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the Sterling Agreement at December 31, \\n2018 and January 31, 2019.

Williams as lenders (collectively, the “Subordinated Lenders”) entered into a certain Amended and \\nRestated  Senior  Subordinated  Convertible  Loan  and  Security  Agreement  (the  “Subordinated  Loan  Agreement”), \\npursuant to which the Subordinated Lenders agreed to provide the Company with a delayed draw term loan facility of up \\nto $750 (“Subordinated Loan Facility”), under which individual advances in amounts not less than $50 may be drawn \\nby the Company.  Interest on the outstanding balance under the Subordinated Loan Facility from time to time, accrues at \\n12%  per  annum  (subject  to  increase  under  certain  circumstances)  and  is  payable  monthly  in-kind  by  the  automatic \\nincrease of the principal amount of the loan on each monthly interest payment date, by the amount of the accrued interest \\npayable at that time (“PIK Interest”); provided, however, that at the option of the Company, it may pay interest in cash \\non  any  interest  payment  date,  in  lieu  of  PIK  Interest.    The  Subordinated  Lenders  have  the  option  of  converting  the \\nprincipal balance of the loan, in whole (unless otherwise agreed by the Company), into shares of the Company’s common \\nstock at a conversion price of $0.54 per share (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances).  This conversion right \\nwas subject to stockholder approval as required by the rules of the NYSE MKT, which approval was obtained on May 24, \\n2016  at  the  Company’s  annual  meeting  of  stockholders.    The  obligations  of  the  Company  and  Drake  under  the \\nSubordinated  Loan  Agreement  are  secured  by  substantially  all  of  the  Company’s  and  Drake’s  assets,  including  by  a \\nmortgage  against  the  Old  Bridge  Facility  (the  “Subordinated  Mortgage”).    The  Subordinated  Loan  Agreement \\nterminates three years from the date of closing, at which time the accreted principal balance of the loan (by virtue of the \\nPIK Interest) plus any other accrued unpaid interest, will be due and payable in full.  \\n\\nOn April 17, 2018, Robert J. Pallé and Carol Pallé exercised their conversion rights and converted $455 ($350 \\nprincipal and $105 of accrued interest) of their loan (representing the entire amount of principal and interest outstanding \\nand held by Mr. and Mrs. Pallé on that date) into 842 shares of the Company’s common stock. \\n\\nOn October 9, 2018, James H. Williams exercised his conversion right and converted $67 ($50 principal and $17 \\nof  accrued  interest)  of  his  loan  (representing  the  entire  amount  of  principal  and  interest  outstanding  and  held  by  Mr. \\nWilliams on that date) into 125 shares of the Company’s common stock. \\n\\nIn  connection  with  the  Subordinated  Loan  Agreement,  the  Company,  Drake,  the  Subordinated  Lenders  and \\nSterling entered into a Subordination Agreement (the “Subordination Agreement”), pursuant to which the rights of the \\nSubordinated Lenders under the Subordinated Loan Agreement and the Subordinated Mortgage are subordinate to the \\nrights of Sterling under the Sterling Agreement and related security documents.  The Subordination Agreement precludes \\nthe Company from making cash payments of interest in lieu of PIK Interest, in the absence of the prior written consent of \\nSterling.   \\n\\nAs of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Subordinated Lenders had advanced $500 to the Company.  In \\naddition, $39 and $124 of PIK interest was accrued as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Company evaluated the conversion option embedded in the Subordinated Loan Agreement \\nissued in December 2016 in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined \\nthat the conversion option had all of the characteristics of a derivative in its entirety and did not qualify for an exception \\nto  the  derivative  accounting  rules.   Specifically,  prior  to  the  adoption  of  the  First  Sub-Debt  Amendment,  pursuant  to \\nSection  4.4(e)(ii)  of  the  Subordinated  Debt  Agreement,  the  exercise  price  of  the  conversion  option  entitled  the \\nSubordinated Lenders to an adjustment of the exercise price in the event that the Company subsequently issued equity \\nsecurities or equity linked securities at prices more favorable to a new investor than the exercise price of the conversion \\noption embedded in the Subordinated Loan Agreement (the “Price Protection Provision”).  Accordingly, the conversion \\noption  was  not  indexed  to  the  Company’s  own  stock.    Due  to  the  derivative  treatment  of  the  conversion  option,  the \\nCompany recorded $260 derivative liability at December 31, 2016.  On March 21, 2017, the Company, Drake, and the \\nSubordinated Lenders entered into a certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Convertible Loan and Security \\nAgreement (the “First Sub-Debt Amendment”), pursuant to which the Subordinated Loan Agreement was amended to \\neliminate  the  Price  Protection  Provision,  effective  as  of  such  date.    The  First  Sub-Debt  Amendment  also  eliminated \\ncertain defined terms related to the Price Protection Provision.  As a result of the First Sub-Debt Amendment, during the \\nfirst quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a change in the derivative liability (expense) of $142, the fair value of the \\nliability  at  the  date  of  the  modification  and  reclassed  the  aggregate  value  of  the  derivative  liability  at  the  date  of \\nmodification in the amount of $402 additional paid-in capital.  In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018 and \\n2017, the Company incurred interest of $37 and $71 respectively, related to these loans.

The defined benefit pension plan is closed to new entrants and existing \\nparticipants do not accrue any additional benefits.  The Company complies with minimum funding requirements.  The total \\nexpense for this plan was $48 in 2018 and $9 in 2017, respectively. \\n\\nThe Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension plan measured as the difference between the \\nfair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018 \\nand 2017, the funded status related to the defined benefit pension plan was overfunded by $288 and $314, respectively, and is \\nrecorded in current assets.  \\n\\nNote 9 - Related Party Transactions \\n\\nOn March 28, 2016, the Company’s current Chief Executive Officer and his wife, together with two of the Company’s \\nindependent directors, as lenders, and the Company and Drake, as borrowers, entered into the Subordinated Loan Agreement \\npursuant to which they agreed to provide the Company with the Subordinated Loan Facility in an amount up to $750, all as \\nmore fully described in Note 6, above.   \\n\\nA  director  and  shareholder  of  the  Company  is  a  partner  of  a  law  firm  that  serves  as  outside  legal  counsel  for  the \\nCompany.  During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, this law firm billed the Company approximately $752 and \\n$358, respectively for legal services provided by this firm.  Included in accounts payable on the accompanying balance sheets at \\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, is approximately zero and $25, respectively, owed to this law firm.  \\n\\nNote 10 - Concentration of Credit Risk \\n\\nFinancial  instruments  that  potentially  subject  the  Company  to  significant  concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist \\n\\nprincipally of cash deposits and trade accounts receivable.  \\n\\nCredit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable was concentrated with three and four of the Company’s customers \\nin 2018 and 2017, respectively. These customers accounted for approximately 47% and 65% of the Company’s outstanding \\ntrade accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of \\nits customers’ financial condition, uses credit insurance and requires collateral, such as letters of credit, to mitigate its credit \\nrisk. The deterioration of the financial condition of one or more of its major customers could adversely impact the Company’s \\noperations.  From time to time where the Company determines that circumstances warrant, such as when a customer agrees to \\ncommit to a large blanket purchase order, the Company extends payment terms beyond its standard payment terms.   \\n\\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2018,  one  customer  represented  approximately  23%  and  one  customer \\nrepresented  approximately  14%  of  the  Company’s  net  sales.    During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017,  one  customer \\nrepresented approximately 34% and one customer represented approximately 13% of the Company’s net sales. At December 31, \\n2018,  one  customer  represented  approximately  22%,  one  customer  represented  approximately  14%  and  one  customer \\nrepresented approximately 11% of the Company’s net accounts receivable.  At December 31, 2017, one customer represented \\napproximately 26%, one customer represented approximately 19% and two customers each represented approximately 10% of \\n\\n51 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nthe Company’s net accounts receivable.  The Company had sales outside the United States of approximately 4% and 7% in the \\nyears ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \\n\\nNote 11 – Stock Repurchase Program \\n\\nOn  July  24,  2002,  the  Company  commenced  a  stock  repurchase  program  to  acquire  up  to  $300  of  its  outstanding \\ncommon stock (the “2002 Program”).  The stock repurchase was funded by a combination of the Company’s cash on hand and \\nborrowings against its revolving line of credit.  On February 13, 2007, the Company announced a new stock repurchase program \\nto acquire up to an additional 100 shares of its outstanding common stock (the “2007 Program”).  As of December 31, 2018, \\nthe Company can purchase up to $72 of its common stock under the 2002 Program and up to 100 shares of its common stock \\nunder the 2007 Program.  The Company may, in its discretion, continue making purchases under the 2002 Program up to its \\nlimits, and thereafter to make purchases under the 2007 Program.  During 2018 and 2017, the Company did not purchase any of \\nits Common Stock under the 2002 Program or 2007 Program. \\n\\nNote 12 – Executive Stock Purchase Plan \\n\\nOn June 16, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan”).  The \\nPlan allows executive officers of the Company to elect to purchase common stock of the Company in lieu of receiving a portion \\nof their salary.  The maximum number of shares of common stock that can be purchased by all participants, in the aggregate, \\npursuant to the Plan is 250 shares.  The shares will be purchased directly from the Company at the fair market value of the \\nCompany’s common stock on the date of purchase (based on selling prices reported on NYSE American), which is the payroll \\ndate when the salary is withheld.  As of December 31, 2018, approximately 13 shares were purchased under the Plan. \\n\\nNote 13 – Preferred Stock \\n\\nThe Company is authorized to issue 5,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, voting and other rights and \\npreferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no \\noutstanding preferred shares. \\n\\nNote 14 – Equity Incentive Plans \\n\\nIn  May  2016,  the  stockholders  of  the  Company  approved  the  2016  Employee  Equity  Incentive  Plan  (the  “2016 \\nEmployee  Plan”),  which  authorized  the  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  “Committee”)  to  grant  a \\nmaximum of 1,000 shares of equity based and other performance based awards to executive officers and other key employees of \\nthe  Company.    The  term  of  the  2016  Employee  Plan  expires  on  February  4,  2026.    In  May  2017,  the  stockholders  of  the \\nCompany approved an amendment to the 2016 Employee Plan to increase the annual individual award limits relating to stock \\noptions  and  stock  appreciation  rights  from  100  to  250  shares  of  Common  Stock.  .    In  June  2018,  the  stockholders  of  the \\nCompany  approved an amendment to the 2016 Employee Plan to increase the maximum number of equity based and other \\nperformance awards to 3,000. The Committee determines the recipients and the terms of the awards granted under the 2016 \\nEmployee  Plan,  including  the  type  of  awards,  exercise  price,  number  of  shares  subject  to  the  award  and  the  exercisability \\nthereof.   \\n\\nIn May 2005, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2005 Employee Equity Incentive Plan (the “Employee \\nPlan”),  which  initially  authorized  the  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  “Committee”)  to  grant  a \\nmaximum of 500 shares of equity based and other performance based awards to executive officers and other key employees of \\nthe Company.  In May 2007, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Employee Plan to increase the \\nmaximum number of equity based and other performance awards to 1,100.  In May 2010, the stockholders of the Company \\napproved an amendment to the Employee Plan to increase the maximum number of equity based and other performance awards \\nto 1,600.  In May 2014, the stockholders of the Company approved the amendment and restatement of the Employee Plan to \\nextend  the  term  of  the  Employee  Plan  to  February  7,  2024  and  increase  the  maximum  number  of  equity  based  and  other \\nperformance awards to 2,600.  In June 2018, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Employee Plan to \\nincrease  the  maximum  number  of  equity  based  and  other  performance  awards  to  2,700.  The  Committee  determines  the \\nrecipients and the terms of the awards granted under the Employee Plan, including the type of awards, exercise price, number of \\nshares subject to the award and the exercisability thereof.   \\n\\n52 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nIn May 2016, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2016 Director Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Director \\nPlan”).  The 2016 Director Plan authorizes the Board of Directors (the “Board”) to grant a maximum of 400 shares of equity \\nbased and other performance based awards to non-employee directors of the Company.  The term of the 2016 Director Plan \\nexpires on February 4, 2026. The Board determines the recipients and the terms of the awards granted under the 2016 Director \\nPlan, including the type of awards, exercise price, number of shares subject to the award and the exercisability thereof.  \\n\\nIn  May  2005,  the  stockholders  of  the  Company  approved  the  2005  Director  Equity  Incentive  Plan  (the  “Director \\nPlan”).  The Director Plan authorizes the Board of Directors (the “Board”) to grant a maximum of 200 shares of equity based \\nand  other  performance  based  awards  to  non-employee  directors  of  the  Company.    In  May  2010,  the  stockholders  of  the \\nCompany approved an amendment to the Director Plan to increase the maximum number of equity based and other performance \\nawards to 400.  In May 2014, the stockholders of the Company approved the amendment and restatement of the Director Plan to \\nextend  the  term  of  the  Director  Plan  to  February  7,  2024  and  increase  the  maximum  number  of  equity  based  and  other \\nperformance awards to 600.  The Board determines the recipients and the terms of the awards granted under the Director Plan, \\nincluding the type of awards, exercise price, number of shares subject to the award and the exercisability thereof.  \\n\\nThe  Company  issues  performance  based  stock  options  to  employees.    The  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of \\nperformance stock option awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Compensation expense for stock option \\nawards is amortized on a straight-line basis over the awards’ vesting period.  \\n\\nThe  expected  term  of  the  stock  options  represents  the  average  period  the  stock  options  are  expected  to  remain \\noutstanding  and  is  based  on  the  expected  term  calculated  using  the  approach  prescribed  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange \\nCommission\\'s  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No.  110  for  “plain  vanilla”  options.    The  expected  stock  price  volatility  for  the \\nCompany’s stock options was determined by using an average of the historical volatilities of the Company.  The Company will \\ncontinue to analyze the stock price volatility and expected term assumptions as more data for the Company’s common stock and \\nexercise patterns become available.  The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury instruments whose term \\nwas consistent with the expected term of the Company’s stock options.  The expected dividend assumption is based on the \\nCompany’s  history  and  expectation  of  dividend  payouts.    The  Company  does  not  estimate  forfeitures  based  on  historical \\nexperience but rather reduces compensation expense when they occur.  \\n\\nThe fair value of employee stock options is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods \\nof  the  respective  awards.    The  fair  value  of  employee  stock  options  was  estimated  using  the  following  weighted-average \\nassumptions: \\n\\n \\n \\nFair value of the company’s common stock on date of grant .....................  \\nExpected term .............................................................................................  \\nRisk free interest rate ..................................................................................  \\nDividend yield……………………………………………………………. \\nVolatility .....................................................................................................  \\nFair value of options granted……………………………………………... \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nYears ended December 31, \\n2018 \\n2017 \\n \\n$  0.54 \\n  6.5 years \\n2.02% \\n \\n \\n0.00% \\n        79.0%           \\n \\n\\n \\n$  0.95 \\n \\n6.5 years \\n \\n2.92% \\n \\n0.00% \\n \\n            79.0% \\n \\n$0.68 \\n\\n$0.38 \\n\\nThe following table summarizes total stock-based compensation costs recognized for the years ended December 31, \\n\\n2018 and 2017: \\n\\n \\n \\nCost of goods sold .......................................................................................  \\nSelling expenses ..........................................................................................  \\nGeneral and administrative .........................................................................  \\nResearch and development………………………………………………. \\nTotal ............................................................................................................  \\n\\n \\n$38 \\n \\n74 \\n \\n263 \\n \\n118 \\n \\n              $493 \\n\\nYears ended December 31, \\n2018 \\n2017 \\n\\n \\n\\n$34 \\n \\n33 \\n \\n274 \\n \\n45 \\n \\n             $386 \\n\\n53 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe following table summarizes information about stock-based awards outstanding for the year ended December 31, \\n\\n2018: \\n\\nPlan \\n\\n2016 Employee Plan \\n2016 Director Plan \\nOther \\n2005 Employee Plan \\n2005 Director Plan \\n \\nStock-based awards \\navailable for grant as of \\nDecember 31, 2018 \\n\\n  Stock Options \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n1,452 \\n199 \\n500 \\n1,181 \\n324 \\n3,656 \\n \\n\\n  Restricted Stock \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n48 \\n- \\n \\n88 \\n- \\n136 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nTotal \\n1,500 \\n199 \\n500 \\n1,269 \\n324 \\n3,792 \\n\\n1,271 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nStock options award activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 is as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company granted options under the 2016 Employee Plan, the 2016 \\nDirector Plan, the 2005 Employee Plan as well as non plan grants to purchase 1,546 shares of common stock to its employees \\nand directors.

The  Company  is  required  to \\nrecognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the estimated transition tax, re-\\nmeasuring its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at a 21% rate as well as reassessing the net realizability of its deferred tax \\nassets and liabilities. The onetime transition tax does not apply to the Company as it does not have any undistributed foreign \\nearnings.  The provisional amount related to the re-measurement of its net deferred tax balance is a reduction of approximately \\n$4,100 with an offsetting adjustment to the valuation allowance, resulting in a benefit of $18 recorded in provision (benefit) for \\nincome taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Upon completion \\nof  the  Company’s  2017  U.S.  income  tax  return  in  2018,  the  Company  re-assessed  its  provisional  estimate  within  the \\nmeasurement period guidance outlined in SAB 118 and determined that the original estimate was materially correct. \\n\\nThe following summarizes the benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCurrent: \\n \\n  Federal ...........................................................................................   \\n  State and local ...............................................................................   \\n \\n \\nDeferred: \\n \\n  Federal ...........................................................................................   \\n  State and local ...............................................................................   \\n \\n \\nValuation allowance ..........................................................................   \\nProvision for income taxes ................................................................   \\n \\n\\n2018 \\n\\n \\n$         - \\n27 \\n27 \\n \\n(270)  \\n(3) \\n(273) \\n169 \\n$      (77) \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n2017 \\n\\n \\n \\n  $         - \\n17 \\n \\n \\n17 \\n \\n \\n  4,086  \\n \\n(10) \\n  4,076 \\n  4,111 \\n $      (18) \\n\\n56 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe benefit for income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the applicable Federal statutory rates due to the \\nfollowing for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nProvision (benefit) for Federal income taxes at the statutory rate ..................   \\nState and local income taxes, net of Federal benefit .......................................   \\nPermanent differences: \\n \\n  Other ..........................................................................................................   \\nChange in valuation allowance .......................................................................   \\nRate differential ..............................................................................................   \\nOther ...............................................................................................................   \\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes ...............................................................   \\n\\n2018 \\n$(297) \\n(11) \\n \\n62 \\n169 \\n- \\n- \\n$      (77) \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n2017 \\n$(137) \\n10 \\n \\n147 \\n(4,111) \\n4,078 \\n(5) \\n$      (18) \\n\\n \\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: \\n\\nDecember 31, \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDeferred tax assets: \\n \\n  Allowance for doubtful accounts ..................  \\n \\nInventories .....................................................  \\n \\n \\n \\nIntangible ......................................................  \\n \\n  Share based compensation \\n \\n  Net operating loss carry forward ...................  \\n \\n  Other .............................................................  \\n \\n \\n  Total deferred tax assets ............................  \\n \\nDeferred tax liabilities: \\n \\n  Depreciation ..................................................  \\n \\n    Intangible ......................................................  \\n \\n    Pension liability ............................................  \\n \\nIndefinite life intangibles ..............................  \\n \\n  Total deferred tax liabilities .................   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nValuation allowance ..........................................  \\n \\nNet .....................................................................  \\n\\n \\n\\n2018 \\n\\n$        11  \\n771  \\n112  \\n           125 \\n      6,109 \\n2  \\n7,130 \\n \\n(60) \\n(4) \\n(1) \\n(122) \\n(187) \\n6,943  \\n(6,943) \\n$    - \\n\\n2017 \\n\\n \\n \\n$        38  \\n746  \\n \\n \\n105  \\n            70 \\n       5,874 \\n \\n1  \\n \\n6,834 \\n \\n \\n(44) \\n \\n \\n(4) \\n(12) \\n \\n(104) \\n \\n(164) \\n \\n \\n6,670  \\n \\n(6,774) \\n  $  (104) \\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $27,912 and $16,118 of federal and state net \\noperating loss carryovers (\"NOL\"), respectively, which begin to expire in 2022.

These returns are subject to audit by tax \\n\\nauthorities beginning with the year ended December 31, 2015. \\n\\nNote 16 – Subsequent Events \\n\\nOn  February  1,  2019,  the  Company  completed  the  sale  of  the  Old  Bridge  Facility  to  Jake  Brown  Road,  LLC  (the \\n“Buyer”). In addition, in connection with the completion of the sale, the Company and the Buyer (as landlord) entered into a \\nlease  (the  “Lease”),  pursuant  to  which  the  Company  will  continue  to  occupy,  and  continue  to  conduct  its  manufacturing, \\nengineering, sales and administrative functions in the Old Bridge Facility. \\n\\n \\nThe sale of the Old Bridge Facility was made pursuant to an Agreement of Sale dated as of August 3, 2018 as amended \\nand  extended  (collectively,  the  “Sale  Agreement”).  Pursuant  to  the  Sale  Agreement,  at  closing,  Buyer  paid  the  Company \\n$10,500. In addition, at closing, the Company advanced to the Buyer the sum of $130, representing a preliminary estimate of the \\nCompany’s share (as a tenant of the Old Bridge Facility following closing) of property repairs, as contemplated by the Sale \\nAgreement.  The Company recognized a gain of $7,909 in connection with the sale. \\n\\n \\nIn connection with the completion of the sale of the Old Bridge Facility and entry into the Lease, the Company, R. L. \\nDrake Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“RLD”) and Blonder Tongue Far East, LLC, a wholly-\\nowned subsidiary of the Company (“Far East,”  and together with the Company and RLD, collectively the “Credit Parties”) \\nentered into a Consent Under Loan and Security Agreement (the “Consent”) with Sterling National Bank (as lender and as \\nadministrative agent, “Sterling”).  The Consent relates to the Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) entered \\ninto by the Credit Parties and Sterling on December 28, 2016.  Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, Sterling’s consent was \\nrequired in order for the Company to complete the sale of the Old Bridge Facility.  In addition to providing Sterling’s consent to \\nthe sale, the Consent requires Sterling to execute and deliver a Discharge of Mortgage and Assignment of Leases and Rents (the \\n“Discharge”) to effect the discharge of Sterling’s interests in the Property (as defined in the Consent) originally granted to \\nSterling in the Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement, Fixture Filing and Financing Statement entered \\ninto in connection with the Loan Agreement. The Company paid approximately $3,014 to pay off the Term Loan in connection \\nwith the Discharge.  In addition, the Company paid off the outstanding balance under the Revolver of approximately $2,086. \\n\\n \\nThe Lease will have an initial term of five years and allows the Company to extend the term for an additional five \\nyears following the initial term. The Company is obligated to pay base rent of approximately $837 for the first year of the lease \\nwith the amount of base rent adjusted for each subsequent year to equal 102.5% of the preceding year’s base rent.  The Lease \\nwill be accounted for under Topic 842 as described in Note 1. \\n\\n \\nOn January 24, 2019, the Company and RLD  (with the Company, collectively, the “Borrower”) entered into a Debt \\nConversion and Lien Termination Agreement (the “Conversion and Termination Agreement”) with Robert J. Pallé (“RJP”) \\nand  Carol  M.  Pallé  (collectively,  “Initial  Lenders”),  and  Steven  L.  Shea  and  James  H.  Williams  (collectively,  the \\n“Supplemental Lenders,” and together with the Initial Lenders, collectively, the “Lenders”), and Robert J. Pallé, as Agent for \\nthe Lenders (in such capacity, the “Agent”).   \\n\\n \\nAs of the date of the Conversion and Termination Agreement, the Borrower was indebted to Steven L. Shea (“Shea”) \\nfor the principal and accrued interest relating to a $100 loan advanced by Shea under the Subordinated Loan Agreement (the \\n“Shea Indebtedness”).  In addition, as of the date of the Conversion and Termination Agreement the Initial Lenders remained \\nsubject to a commitment to lend Borrowers up to an additional $250 (the “Additional Commitment”). \\n\\n \\n\\n58 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n\\nAND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n(in thousands, except per share data) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nIn connection with the anticipated completion of the sale of the Old Bridge Facility, the Borrower, the Lenders and the \\nAgent entered into the Conversion and Termination Agreement to provide for (i) the full payment of the Shea Indebtedness \\n(unless such amounts were converted into shares of common stock prior to repayment), (ii) the termination of the Additional \\nCommitment and (iii) the release and termination of all liens and security interests in the collateral under the Subordinated Loan \\nDocuments, including with respect to the Subordinated Mortgages, each to become effective as of the closing of the sale of the \\nOld  Bridge  Facility.    In  connection  with  the  execution  and  delivery  of  the  Conversion  and  Termination  Agreement  by  the \\nBorrower, the Lenders and the Agent, Shea provided the Company with a notice of conversion, and upon completion of the sale \\nof the Old Bridge Facility was issued 260 shares of Company common stock in full satisfaction of the Shea Indebtedness.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n59 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n \\n\\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly \\n\\ncaused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized. \\n\\nSIGNATURES \\n\\nDate:  April 1, 2019 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nBLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. \\n \\n \\nBy:    /s/ Robert J.
